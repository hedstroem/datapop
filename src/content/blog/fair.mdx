Taking notes on what organizations can learn from the FAIR data principles.\
FAIR stands for **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable.

The principles refer to three types of entities: data (or any digital object), 
metadata (information about that digital object) and infrastructure.
For instance, principle F4 defines that both metadata and data are registered
or indexed in a searchable resource (the infrastructure component).

## Findable

*The first step in (re)using data is to find them.*
*Metadata and data should be easy to find both for humans and computers.*
*Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services,*
*so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.*

[F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f1-meta-data-assigned-globally-unique-persistent-identifiers/)

[F2. Data are described by rich metadata.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f2-data-described-rich-metadata/)

[F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f3-metadata-clearly-explicitly-include-identifier-data-describe/)

[F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f4-metadata-registered-indexed-searchable-resource/)

For an organization the mapping of data, metadata and infrastructure must start from the data/system owners.
Take an example of sales numbers.
Sales are typically recorded in an ERP system. 
This system has a owner who is responsible for how it is used in the company.
Because sales numbers are also used for bookkeeping and projections in budgets there are formal processes for aggregation.
In a less data-mature organization the raw data is extracted from the ERP and aggregated in Excel.
If the organization is data-mature then this is done by an automated pipeline which spits out the "truth",
either as an on-demand query or into a database.
In either case, the data owner is the person responsible for the final Excel or automated pipeline output.

In this example, one *should* be able to search the indexing resource for "sales numbers" 
and find a reference for the bookkeeping-sufficient truth.
The metadata should include how the refined data is produced and who to ask (data owner) if there are any follow-up questions.
The metadata should also include how to access the source system in case the raw data needs be reviewed (e.g. sometimes corrupt entries skew aggregates).


## Accessible

*Once the user finds the required data, they need to know how they can be accessed,*
*possibly including authentication and authorisation.*

[A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/metadata-retrievable-identifier-standardised-communication-protocol/)

[A1.1. The protocol is open, free and universally implementable](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a1-1-protocol-open-free-universally-implementable/)

[A1.2. The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a1-2-protocol-allows-authentication-authorisation-required/)

[A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a2-metadata-accessible-even-data-no-longer-available/)

The core message of A1 is simply to avoid complex or proprietary (read: expensive) solutions to accessing your organizational data and metadata.
This does not mean that one should avoid have authorization processes, they are absolutely necessary to protect sensitive information.

An interesting take that A2 brings is that a data-mature organizations should store its data history and lineage in metadata.
Perhaps a business concept become deprecated but bubbles up in discussions 5 years later.
Or ideas that have already been tested and to be avoided again.
Recorded history provides a map for newer employees who lack the context of past discussions.


## Interoperable

*The data usually needs to be integrated with other data.*
*In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage or processing.*

[I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i1-metadata-use-formal-accessible-shared-broadly-applicable-language-knowledge-representation/)

[I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i2-metadata-use-vocabularies-follow-fair-principles/)

[I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i3-metadata-include-qualified-references-metadata/)

For an organization this principle mainly rhymes with master data.
That is, shared business concepts like customers, product codes, currencies, supplier numbers, etc.
Creating and maintaining master data can be a tedious process because typically
legacy integrations betweens systems and processes come with their own unique translation layers and concept representations.
Having a map of the web of core business concepts can be a great cheat sheet for new and old employees.


## Reusable

*The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimize the reuse of data.*
*To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.*

[R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-metadata-richly-described-plurality-accurate-relevant-attributes/)

[R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-1-metadata-released-clear-accessible-data-usage-license/)

[R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-2-metadata-associated-detailed-provenance/)

[R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-3-metadata-meet-domain-relevant-community-standards/)

To make data reusable the metadata must provide appropriate context.
When can you use these numbers? For what purposes? Who is the data owner?
Given that the data are findable, accessible and interoperable;
one still needs to know the factors that impact the level of data quality.
An organization should also provide clear guidelines for how to aggregate insights.
For example, when talking about how much product was shipped in the year,
do you use the data when it was loaded on a truck or the date it was loaded off at the customer location?

## Conclusion

FAIR provides a framework for reproducible, scientific data.

For an organization one should apply that framing to the level where it is applicable.
If analytics or research is a critical part of your operations then following FAIR principles ensures fewer blockers.
There is a cost-benefit analysis that should be performed based on the number of interested consumers, business value and potential for innovation.
*Not all data needs to be FAIR, but almost all data benefit from some degree of FAIR.*
