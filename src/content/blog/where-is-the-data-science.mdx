After almost 4,5 months of paternal leave, reflecting on work as a data scientist,
and writing down snippets on how to leadership, design and innovation, 
I am ready to tackle the ambitious idea of writing a piece on data science as a whole.
The question of the hour is, organizationally, **where is the data science?**

The answer, in short, is that organizationally data science is a problem solving engine.
Data scientists can be seen as expert consultants that addresses problems and help to discover insights with data driven methods.

# Argument

## First of all, data science is not about building

It is the role of architects to architect, engineers to engineer and developers to develop.
Think of in terms of construction, an architect draws a plan for a building that will serve as a cultural center,
the engineer converts the plans into blueprints where the constraints of costs and physics have been accounted for
and the developer constructs the building within an operational budget.
All of the steps involve problem solving in different domains.

Nothing prevents someone from saddling multiple roles, e.g. as a data scientist and an engineer, but they are fundamentally two different roles.
So if the data scientist has nothing to do with (the) construction (of software); where can they contribute?

A data scientist require a relatively mature ecosystem to thrive:
* (Business) problems to address
* Access to data
* Data is trusted
* Possibility to combine multiple data sources
* Concepts can be meaningfully validated
* Knowledge, insights, learnings and tools get accumulated over time

Therefore we can summarize the role as: **Data scientists work with data to address (business) problems.**\
There are many roles and titles like statistician, engineer, research scientist, specialist, analyst, etc. that run parallel to the data science one.
All of them typically work with and interpret data in some capacity.

Much like scientists work with formulating and testing hypotheses with rigor, 
breaking new ground and advancing (shared) knowledge;
data scientists are expected to borrow some of those traits but typically to benefit a business.
This is also why having a PhD is meritous in most data science job postings.

## Second of all, data science is not core business

When a data science concept has been validated, 
whether it is the foundational idea for a piece of software,
an alteration to an existing product
or a new business process;
the interest to take it to the next level can not reside with the data scientist.
If the organization you as a data science leader is working toward can not provide enough engagement, 
then consider nudging the funnel toward other parts of the organization.

Similarly, avoid situations where data science becomes a potential bottleneck in projects or products.
That would be a symptom of misaligned intentions because a scientific role is hard to time-box.
Instead, shift the workflow to focus on leads where you can manage a relatively high initial failure rate ([see the post of innovation](https://datapop.netlify.app/blog/design-and-innovation/)). 
This is why data science can not be a core business.
Instead it is a bet and a leverage for future potential.

The high failure rate should be expected because there are a lot of good ideas to investigate
but where the data turns out to be impossible to acquire, trust or model effectively.
Maintaining a record of which ideas has been considered, tried and tested is important to continually map the organizational maturity.

## Data science plugs into innovation, R\&D, CoE and effectivization.

**Innovation**\
The goal of innovation is to come up with new offerings or (re)invent processes.\
*A data scientist can compile decision support for the innovation process.*

**Research \& Development**\
The goal of R\&D is to adapt existing, improve or invent technologies.\
*A data scientist can perform pre and post product research.*

**Center of Excellence**\
The goal of a CoE is to establish and promote best practices, standards and knowledge.\
*A data scientist can educate and consult other roles on data-driven ways of working.*

**Effectivization**\
The goal of effectivization is to achieve a better result without considerable investments.\
*A data scientist can analyze processes and project impact from potential changes.*

Across all four areas, the common theme is applying analysis to reduce uncertainty.

Also note that all of them are nice-to-have and not must-have's.
The resources spent on projects where data scientists can contibute will shrink in a crisis.
On the other hand, data scientists have an important role in safeguarding against and capitalizing on what awaits in the future.
The title does well to conclude where a data science function can find its place organizationally.

# Counterargument

## Data psuedoscience

Data science is generally not *real* science and equating the two is giving data science false credibility.
What one might call data science has been done by researchers, scientists, engineers, statisticians and mathematicians for ages.
It is simply a collection of skills that analytical roles need and not a necessarily a role in itself.
One could therefore argue that there is no place for data science organizationally.

## Doubling down - Democratization digests data science

With the rise of large language models (LLM) it has become easier than ever to get assistance with coding, 
reasoning about problems and analyzing data.
The data scientist role is a transitional artifact that will dissolve into new or traditional analytical roles.
There will still be a need for machine learning researchers, supply chain modeling experts and business analysts, 
which are aspects of what data scientists can do today.

## Actions speak louder than words

Trying to isolate data science from software as a concept is an unnecessary abstraction.
Software is not the only type of deliverable (e.g. a written report) but these days **shipping** (software) is king.
You are a part of a team building a forecasting model, an AI agent or an image detection system.
The new trendy role is the AI engineer. It is the data scientist / machine learning engineer crossed with a full stack developer.
These are the sort of people companies want to hire and organize teams around, not those who refuse to get their hands dirty.
One could therefore argue that data science is something performed by members of a team delivering a data / AI solution.

## Doubling down - Data science can not operate on its own

To quote an earlier part of the post: *"A data scientist require a relatively mature ecosystem to thrive."*\
This means that data scientists are highly dependent on information architects, data engineers and software engineers to operate.
In order to make this a reality one should ideally place data science within a data / AI grouping where complementary roles exist.
If placed outside then it will lead to unnecessary lead times, potential culture drift and resource rivalry.
One could therefore argue that data science should not exist in isolation.

## In conclusion

The main point of the counterargument is that data science is a dated catch-all concept for data-driven work
and that it belongs to a set of analytical roles.
Organizations should reflect how work will be done in the future, not how it was carried out after the big data boom. 
Today there are blueprints on how to form and manage teams for AI engineering, machine learning and analytics.
No need to have a team of generalists trying do to a bit of everything.
Gone are the days of hiring your first data scientist and have them roleplay data engineer, 
business intelligence developer and machine learning engineer.

# Rebuttal

## Data science moves closer to the business

The counterargument makes valid points. 
Gone are the days where the data scientists were the only ones who knew how to train machine learning models.
The first roles to break off should be the technical nichés, much like machine learning or AI engineers.
One can see this being extended to algorithm researchers, A/B testers, language model specialists and so forth.

**So where does that leave the traditional data scientist role?
The business problems.**\
A data scientist should perhaps not own the initiative in driving change, that is still the responsiblity of the business side.
But perhaps the data scientists can take shares where business analysts or other business-oriented analytical roles run the show.
Why? To enable faster iterations on insights from data.

In the past more engineering-minded people have wanted to offload the responsiblity of talking to the business.
At the same time there have been a movement of business-oriented people who want to adopt and enable new technologies.
This has created setups in many companies where analytical or technical projects have 1. the business side
2. the technical side and 3. the business-translator layer.
The third leg is there for robustness sake but the consequence is that it can make the business less engaged.
This is because the responsiblity of moving things forward has shifted to the value-focused, usually project managing, resource in the team.

The business side has and always will be busy but if a problem truly is important to address then they will find the time.
Offloading makes participation without engagement possible, which drags out the process, 
opens up for misalignment and missed opportunities in the translation layer.

## Internal consultants we are

A data scientist grouping should act as internal consultants within their organization.
This allows them to focus their resources on business problems in environments with sufficient data maturity.
The result is a short time between question and potential insights.
And if the data maturity is lacking? Then they can put you in contact with information architects and data engineers.

So how do we select which business areas to address?
By mapping the data and tool maturity one has a pretty good idea of how much effort is required (i.e. cost).
The question then comes down to the relative benefit of different business areas.
Estimated, measured and reported value should ideally be owned by the business side
but is definetly something the data science organization has to look out for.

**In the end spending on data science is a bet on insights that can get you (further) ahead.**
It is different then a team developing a software to be sold, subscribed to or used by the business.
Many data scientists can work and thrive in those teams as well but then they would be focusing on more specific tasks than data science.
