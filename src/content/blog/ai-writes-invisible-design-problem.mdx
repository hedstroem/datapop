*Note from me:*\
I normally use ChatGPT \& Claude for brainstorming or learning about new topics.\
Here I let them author this post. I only seeded the idea, then let ChatGPT draft and Claude adjust.

No wonder people can output so much on LinkedIn these days...

# **The Invisible Design Problem**

For years, tech teams have talked about the blurred lines between roles. 
Developers who do ops. Designers who write research plans. Researchers who moonlight as product strategists. 
But one line stays especially blurry — and carries real weight for how products take shape:

**Product managers are increasingly performing design work.**

Sometimes intentionally. Often accidentally. And almost always without acknowledging that the shift is happening.

This isn't a turf war argument. The pattern is simply *true*, and it's reshaping how digital products are conceived, scoped, and delivered. 
Understanding it matters for anyone building software in 2025 — because when design decisions happen without design expertise, everyone loses.

---

## **The Roots of the Blur**

You can trace the trend to a few structural forces:


### **1. Teams ship faster than design scales**

Design teams rarely grow at the same rate as engineering and product. 
When deadlines loom and designers are stretched thin, PMs fill the vacuum with "quick sketches,"
flow diagrams, requirements that imply UI, or decision-making that effectively defines the user experience.


### **2. Agile and product frameworks invite PMs into solution space**

Scrum, SAFe, dual-track discovery — pick your favorite (or least favorite) framework.
All encourage PMs to articulate what users need, prioritize solutions, and create crisp acceptance criteria. 
But in practice, those responsibilities bleed into UX shaping.

User stories like *"As a customer, I want to see my monthly spending broken down by category so that…"*
often come bundled with a PM's mental storyboard of how it should look.
What begins as requirements ends as a sketch. 
And that sketch becomes a screenshot. 
And that screenshot becomes a real interface.


### **3. Organizations increasingly seek "full-stack" product talent**

LinkedIn, for example, recently shifted its product career track to emphasize
"full-stack builders" — people who can design, research, manage, and influence the entire product lifecycle.
Industry blogs and conferences have been pushing variants of the "UX-minded product manager" concept for years.
When the market tells PMs that being part-designer increases their value, 
you'll see more PMs stepping into design territory.


### **4. Many PMs come from business backgrounds with no design training**

Here's the uncomfortable truth that few articles mention: 
A significant portion of product managers didn't start in tech. 
They pivoted from business analysis, process optimization, change management, or economics.
They're smart, strategic thinkers who understand stakeholder management and business logic.

But they often know little to nothing about interaction design, 
visual hierarchy, cognitive load, or human-centered research methods.
This creates two distinct problems:

**The Confident Amateur:** 
A PM who's read a few UX articles and thinks they understand design principles
well enough to make UI decisions. They're aware of design as a discipline
but overestimate their competence.

**The Unaware Architect:** 
A former business analyst or process developer who doesn't realize that "defining the solution" *is* design work. 
They see their detailed requirement specifications as simply being thorough,
not understanding that when they dictate how information should be organized or how a workflow should unfold,
they're making interaction design choices.

The second group is often more problematic because they're operating without any awareness of the boundary.
They're not overstepping — they don't see a boundary to begin with.

## **PMs Don't Just Influence Design — They Shape It**

One of the most insightful findings from Nielsen Norman Group's
research on PM and UX ambiguity is that **PMs often believe they "own" parts of the design process**
, especially early-stage conceptual design and user definition. 
Designers, meanwhile, assume they own it. That difference in perception *is the blur*.

A PM's influence on design usually shows up in four ways:

1. **Problem Framing** — PMs define which user problems matter. This inherently shapes the design.
2. **Constraints** — Budgets, timelines, and scope boundaries force certain UX paths.
3. **Narrative** — PMs articulate the story: who the user is, what their journey looks like, and what's meaningful.
4. **Artifacts** — Low-fi flows, feature outlines, "vision decks," or even Miro boards that start to look suspiciously like wireframes.

You can say "PMs don't design," but the truth is that **framing the solution and shaping the narrative *is design work***.
The challenge isn't that PMs think about the user experience — they should.
The challenge is when they *decide* the user experience without design expertise guiding those decisions.

---

## **The BA Mindset: Process Logic vs. Human Behavior**

When PMs come from business analysis backgrounds, they bring a specific lens that often conflicts with user-centered design:

**Business analysts think in:**
- Process flows and system states
- Data models and business rules
- Edge cases and exception handling
- Efficiency and risk mitigation

**Designers think in:**
- User journeys and mental models
- Cognitive load and information hierarchy
- Emotional responses and trust signals
- Clarity and human comprehension

When a BA-turned-PM creates a "user flow," it often reflects *system logic* rather than *human behavior*.
The result? Interfaces that are technically complete but feel mechanical, confusing, or exhausting to use.

The spreadsheet makes sense. The user experience doesn't.

## **How to Tell If This Is Happening to You**

Here are the red flags that design decisions are happening without design leadership:

- **Requirements documents that specify UI elements**<br>
"The dashboard should show a card for each category with the total in bold at the top"</br>
- **PMs presenting wireframes in planning meetings**<br>
Even "rough sketches" are design artifacts</br>
- **User stories that describe solutions, not problems**<br>
"As a user, I want a dropdown menu" vs. "As a user, I want to quickly find my account type"</br>
- **Engineers asking designers to "make it look nice"**<br>
Meaning the interaction model is already decided</br>
- **Designers learning about features the week before launch**<br>
Because the "thinking" was done without them</br>
- **Products that work but feel clunky**<br>
Technically functional, humanly frustrating</br>

If you nodded at three or more of these, your team is experiencing design by proxy.

## **The Real Cost of Accidental Design**

This isn't just about hurt feelings or territorial boundaries. 
There are tangible consequences:

### **1. Products that feel mechanical instead of human**

When design happens through a business logic lens, 
you get interfaces that reflect database structures,
not how people actually think or work.
Everything is "correct" but nothing feels intuitive.

### **2. Demoralized designers who become validators**

By the time design sees the problem, the solution space is already shaped.
Designers react instead of lead. This is why good designers leave teams where they're treated as "UI decorators."

### **3. Technical debt from poorly conceived patterns**

UI patterns that weren't thought through by someone who understands interaction design create ongoing maintenance problems. 
The codebase accumulates band-aids for fundamental experience issues.

### **4. Missed opportunities to solve the actual problem**

When PMs jump to solutions based on business requirements rather than user research,
teams often build the wrong thing efficiently. The requirements were met. 
The user's real need wasn't.

---

## **But Wait — Should PMs Ever Do Design Work?**

Here's a reasonable counterargument: 
In small teams, early-stage startups, or resource-constrained environments, 
having PMs sketch low-fidelity concepts can actually *accelerate* collaboration.
It gives designers something concrete to react to and helps align the team quickly.

The problem isn't that PMs design. It's when they:
- Design *badly* (without understanding core principles)
- Design *without awareness* (thinking they're just "being thorough")
- Design *as final decisions* (not as conversation starters)

There's a meaningful difference between "Here's a rough idea to discuss" and "Here's what we're building."

And yes, designers also bear some responsibility here. 
When design teams can't articulate their strategic value beyond
"making things pretty" or fail to understand business constraints,
it's easier for PMs to justify stepping into that space. 
Design needs to earn its seat at the table by demonstrating business acumen, not just craft skill.

---

## **What Healthy Collaboration Actually Looks Like**

The solution isn't to police boundaries but to clarify them — and to acknowledge when you're crossing into another discipline:

**PMs define:**
- The problem and its business context
- Success criteria and metrics
- Constraints (budget, timeline, technical)
- Strategic priorities

**Designers define:**
- The experience and interaction patterns
- Information architecture and content hierarchy
- Visual design and interface consistency
- How the solution feels to use

**Engineers define:**
- Technical feasibility and implementation approach
- Performance characteristics
- System behavior and error handling
- Quality and maintainability

Where things overlap, transparency is everything:

> "I'm sketching this to communicate intent, not to dictate the actual UX."
>
> "Here's the technical constraint; let's explore design options that fit."
>
> "This requirement implies a specific UI. Let's revisit the problem first."

The key is making design decision-making visible and intentional, not accidental.

---

## **The Uncomfortable Question**

There's a bigger issue lurking beneath all this:\
**Is this trend partly because design hasn't made its strategic value clear enough?**

If PMs are stepping into design territory unchecked,
is it because organizations fundamentally don't understand what design contributes beyond aesthetics?
Have design teams failed to demonstrate that good interaction design directly impacts business outcomes?

When leadership sees design as "making the product pretty" rather than "making the product work for humans",
they'll deprioritize it. And when design is deprioritized, someone else fills that space.

Usually the PM.

---

## **The Takeaway**

PMs are designing. Often without training. Sometimes without awareness.
And almost always without teams acknowledging that design decisions
are being made in places other than the design function.

This isn't about shrinking anyone's role or drawing rigid boundaries.
It's about recognizing that **design expertise matters**,
and that well-intentioned people making design decisions without that
expertise create real problems — for users, for teams, and for products.

The modern product team isn't defined by clean lines.
It's defined by intentional collaboration and honest conversations
about who's qualified to make which decisions.
Everyone should think about the user experience.
Not everyone should decide it.
And the more we name these dynamics explicitly, the better our products — and our teams — will be.
