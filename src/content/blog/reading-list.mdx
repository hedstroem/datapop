This reading list is updated sporadically.

## Books

- **Good to great** - *Jim Collins* <br> 
This book made me understand just *how* fundamental certain challenges can be to an organisation.
Before I used to think that if I, an employee, worked harder and spoke my mind; 
that it would change the course of the group or the company for the better. 
After this book I realize that changing things to get positive development means reworking the DNA of the business.
And that's not something a single contributor can do. </br>

- **Build** - *Tony Fadell* <br> 
Lots of nuggets for how to think about products and organisation. </br>

- **Measure what matters** - *John Doerr* <br>
This book is the book on Objectives & Key Results, OKR's for short. 
I read this because a department manager wanted to introduce it to our group.
I was intrigued how goals can progression can be tracked over different hierarchy levels.
Unfortunately this manager did not do the theory justice nor did he actually follow up the scappy goals we set for the quarter.</br>

- **Bullshit jobs** - *David Groeber* <br> 
The first half outlines job archetypes that passes the time without long-term productivity. 
It is a dark and funny characterisation of modern, mostly white-collar, work.
The second half attempts to diagnose why we have gotten to this point.
It is an interesting perspective and worth the read. </br>

## Take aways
* No strategy can save a lack of culture and that no culture can save a lack of leadership.

* The *Peter principle* and the *Dilbert principle* and the saying (by third source) 
"that promotition to management was a terrible waste of competence, wasn't it?"
all point to a strange intersection of **Good to great** and **Bullshit jobs**.
The not-so-flattering way to put it is "managers who have reached the limit of their
competence will not identify and prioritize actual progess, instead they will 
invent comfortable work and focus on prestige".
