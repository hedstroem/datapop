# Aspects of being a leader

This is a non-exhaustive list of some aspects of being a leader.

## 1. Orientation

All positions of leadership are unique.
It is therefore fitting that orientation is fundamental.
If something is unclear after orientation then it is probably going to be something you and your team will struggle with.
I think the Drexler / Sibbet Team Performance Model (TPM) captures this in an excelent way.

![Team Performance Model](https://i0.wp.com/www.robertmcneil.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Drexler_Sibbet_Model.jpg?resize=1024%767&ssl=1)
[Source](https://davidsibbet.com/process-models/)

The interpretation of TPM is; if anything fails like "Why can't we set meaningful goals?" then the root cause it probably
a lack of trust (step 2) or confusion about why we are here in the first place (step 1).

When leading a group one must be able to answer "why are we here?" in a way that balances 
the polar-opposite question "why should we not be here?".
These questions are be layered like an onion of course because there are layers that are more and less paletable.

You as a leader have a big impact on the group culture, so your answers to the questions are key.
It is also an important signal if you can not motivate the *why* of something,
especially if it is key to your "survival".
Take this next section as a great example of what you should be able to superbly motivate.

## 2. Why should people come to us?

People and resources cost. What are you providing in return that motivates those costs?
It is okay if the returns are high risk / high reward, abstract or even idealistic but they require more trust than, you know, iron ore.
This is why almost all leaders have to do some amount of business-thinking.
You are after all the person responsible for finding work for your team
and you are also responsible for making sure that the outcome is satisfactory for all.

You often have to orient yourself, evaluate the streams of work that you have and continually consider potentially new streams.
Of course, successful businesses (one of the lessons from Jim C. Collins *Good to Great*) employ what is called Hedgehog concept,
illustrated by this diagram:

![Hedgehoc concept](https://i0.wp.com/www.monkhouseandcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-29-at-14.09.59.png?resize=578%2C463&ssl=1)
[Source](https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/resources/insight/7-important-lessons-from-jim-collins-good-to-great/)

This is what you fall back on rainy days (or years).
You have already set yourself up for trouble if you think *execution* follows "don't put all your eggs in one basket".
Your core business can itself be diverse, like marketing or research, but you are unlikely to require multiple, potentially competing schemes.

## 3. Execution matters and feedback on execution matters

As a leader, whether it be through management or seniority, you have to define what is a job well done.
This matters for feedback, your team should know what they are doing well (and should be celebrated for, and do more of) 
and where they could improve (which raises the question if they need training e.t.c.).
And to be crass, a job well done has less to do with the technical details and more to do with the alignment of the core business.

In John Doerr's "Measure What Matters", the book on [Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)](https://www.whatmatters.com/get-examples#engineering),
he describes that the effect of properly implemented OKRs is that everyone is aware of how their results are contributing to the objectives.
In such an environment you are getting feedback regularly and the need for a "check-in" at the yearly performance review becomes superflous.

Of course it can be hard to have a job whose function can be captured in 3-5 quarterly key results, but trying is important.
People also need their hedgehog concepts. 
If someone is doing too many tasks or saddling too many roles then it is probably a sign of uncertainty or disorganisation.

## 4. Reasonable restraint

Micromanagement can be a difficult itch but restraint is almost always the solution.
You are taking time away from yourself and the person you are overriding is probably not learning that much either.
The book ["the making of a manager" by Julie Zhuo](https://www.juliezhuo.com/book/manager.html) expanded my perspective on this by showing me more situations to be restrained.

One paraphrased example would be "you are probably assisting those falling behind way more than you are boosting those with good pace".
Another one is "focus on your time where you can be a force multiplier instead of an adding force (you going in an doing the job yourself)".
Restraint and reflection is the answer. Use your manager or your mentors for discussing strategies.
Another thing is that you can also ask your team for feedback, but expect them to package it differently then if you were a fellow colleague.

## 5. The tensions of leadership

The hardest part of leading is that you can not do it perfectly.
* You will have to make decisions under uncertainty.
* You will have to settle disputes, even when it might rustle some feathers.
* You will have to shoot down and ignore so many great proposals.
* You will have power over people, which changes how they view you.
* Some discussions will be a bit awkward.
* In some situations you can not be completely transparent.
* You will be judged for action and inaction alike.

That is why we emphasise trust.
Given that you have the skills to actually maneuver the complex business environment, having people trust you is key.
If you earn people's trust then they will forgive your shortcomings, because they know that you have got their back.
This is a property that management share with politicians.
It is only fair because with the role comes power, which must be wielded resposibly.

This post is not meant to rant about pathologies of leadership and power, 
but one humorous, dark take on it is [David Groeber's "Bullshit jobs"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs#:~:text=More%20than%20half,%5B3%5D).
He captures what happens in late-stage capitalist societies where looking busy and sounding important trumphs productivity.

## 6. Your team(s)

Being a team leader and in particular a manager means *getting better outcomes from a group of people working together* (Julie Zhuo).
Everything we have covered on being oriented in your environment, having clear goals, giving feedback, showing restraint and building trust are components to make a team function well.

Julie also compiles a few summaries of what managers should focus on during a day:
* Her own days can be categorized with: Purpose, people & process. Purpose is the outcome your team is trying to accomplish - the why. Why do you wake up and choose to do *this* instead of the thousands of other things you could be doing? Why pour your time and energy into this particular goal with this particular group of people? Then there is people - the who. Are the team members of your team set up to succeed? Do they have the right skills? Are they motivated? Process - the how. The word conjures nightmares but the point of having & knowing processes is so *simple tasks do not get enormously complicated*.
* Her summary of Chris Cox: "Half of what he looked at was my team's results - did we achieve our aspirations? The other half was based on the strength and satisfaction of my team - did I do a good job hiring and developing individuals, and was my team happy and working well together?"
* Her summary of J. Richard Hackmans five conditions: Having a real team (one with clear boundaries and stable membership), a complelling direction, an enabling structure, a supportive organizational context and expert coaching.

### Team composition, role balance and skill distribution

Sometimes you get to choose your team, sometimes you inherit it.
It goes without saying but balancing the work, both internally and in interface with other teams, is a complex environment.
If you think back to the Hedgehog concept, we need to match **passion** of the team with what they as a group can **excel** at to meet the external **demand**.

* Passion - Changing the passion of team members is nigh impossible.
That is trying to make someone love you.
Only drastic gambles, like letting someone change their career path could potentially reignite fading passion.
If the passion is not there then people are unlikely to stick around for a long time.
The best you can do is hire passionate people and shift the culture toward that desired norm.

* Excellence - What the group can excel at is more flexible.
You can shift tasks and responsiblities around.
You can rework processes meaning that tasks take a new form.
You can outsource some work aspects to other teams or bring in aspects previously handled by other groups.
You can give people the time to develop new skills or learn a new tool.

* Demand - The external demand is also subject to some flexibility.
Given that changing a groups composition is a slow process without extreme measures it might be possible to shift the sources of work.
Of course, this only work if what governs you allow it.
A start-up is free to pivot as it wants but a function within a large organization probably have some hardcoded responsiblities.

Your team relies on you for shifting the culture in a positive direction, assisting their individual development
and bringing in a steady source of tasks that suit their profile. 
The external environment relies on you to effectively lead and/or manage your team to make it worth the cost.

When I was reading Tony Fadell's ["Build"](https://www.buildc.com/the-book) I was captures by chapter 2.2 titled "Facts vs Opinions".
He argues that the recent leader obsession with being "fact-oriented" or "data-driven" has some downsides.
One of the downside is analysis-paralysis, being stuck in prestudy-prugatory.
Another downside is that it downplays the importance of showing character and good values.

## 7. Showing character and good values

Showing character is an aspect of leadership that is double-edged.
If it turns out that you have good values then people will remember you.
If not then they probably will but for the wrong reasons.
The fundamental question is: "Does your values match your role?".

# My values

* Physics
    - Approach problems from first principles.
    - Even simple systems can be studied almost indefinitely.
    - "Somebody probably though of this over a 100 years ago".
* Engineering
    - Product longevity comes in at the design phase. A well-engineered thing last longer and keeps its value.
    - "Any idiot can build a bridge but only an engineer can build a bridge that barely holds."
    - I am suspicious if something (read: my code) works on the first try.
* Data science 
    - "Somebody probably thought of this in the 60s".
    - Technical superiority is no replacement for data and domain knowledge.
    - Creativity is usually the difference between mediocre and stellar solutions.
* Customer-facing
    - Have a customizable but standard plan for how you roll out a solution.
    - Pick up on what actually matters for the customer and find the root problem to adress.
    - Have a realistic dialogue about the future of things, no zombie products or projects!
* In general
    - I keep my ears open to quickly form myself an understanding of what is going on.
    - I like to make people happy and engaged. I would like for those meaning well to be successful.
    - I like to explain ideas. I also love to brainstorm and spar ideas. It is a team sport.
    - I would like to believe that I stay humble in most situations.

# Playbook

**My view on data science** - It is the intersection of data, its interpretation, its transformation, statistics,
optimization, machine learning, signal processing. Programming is a tool but code is not the main goal, 
insights and decision support are.
Data is typically tabular but graphs, images, video, audio, GIS are workable.

Given my background I would likely lead in a data science context but that itself is not given.
Other domains of interest like finance, supply chain, logistics, sales and product all benefit from someone
with data science thinking and the potential for leading department process transformation.

## 1. Having and tracking concrete targets, goals and progress

Recognition is important.
People appreciate you being aware of what they are working on.
This can be tied together with what you present outward as group performance.
There should be some targets that are key to the groups continued existence.
Basically metrics of your Hedgehog concept.
This can be number of completed projects or number of sales.
If you are a function in a supply chain, say logistics of finished product to market, 
then the progress (perhaps measured in %) of finished product left to the market is one of many metrics.

Basically your budgeted numbers.

However, this is mainly for you and it can even demotivating for your team if the numbers are looking gloom.
Instead it is also important to set goals, objectives where you as a team can excel and grow.
Goals should be set on a group level but also on a personal level.
Their concreteness can vary.
If someone is supposed to be a researcher but is always involved in other projects then stating "at least 60% research time" is a goal.
If you commit to such a goal then defending against those external pulls will require support and backing.

Speaking of being a researcher, goals like "publish 2 findings this year" is not a motivating goal.
Research, design or even engineering rarely benefit from commands like "innovate at least 2 things this year".
Instead they require people to follow their passions until one day, something magical happens... or at least, 
until a point of maturity where other, more structured processes can join in or take over.
Instead of goals I would like to call this progress.

Keeping a list of progress is better than setting goals. 
This list should be continually updated and shared within the teams.
Progress should not only be strictly positive. 
If someone is stuck in a dead-end project then helping them get out of it and writing a lessons learned note, is progress.
If someone has not progressed in a while, then it is a signal to check-in, see if there are some interesting *negative* results that can be shared.
It is important to also say "we tried this and it did not work" or "this was a waste of time".
It is healthy to review these events you one can figure out how to do less of it in the future.

Now, there are a lot of things here. Targets. Goals. Progress. So here is a shorthand:

* Targets are my problem. This is what we sell outwards (goals are bonuses). Progess can be fed into targets.
* Goals can have varying length, but 1 quarter to 1 year are good spans. They should capture team ambitions.
* Progress is what your team will know. It is part of your day-to-day routine.

## 2. Data strategy

No matter which side of the table I am on, I can not help myself to create a data strategy if one does not exist.

We start by asking questions like:
* What data to we need to operate? 
* Where does it exist?
* Is that the ground truth data?
* Who owns the data?
* How can we access it?
* How often do we need it?
* Who else needs it?
* Which processes are in place today?
* Can we prioritize the data? Which ones are must-haves and which ones are nice-to-have?

Then one needs can start sketching when can we have data X, Y, Z and at what level.
If the data maturity of the organization is high then the rest is trivial.
An information architect and a pair of data engineers can easily transfer data to where it need to be, in the right shape.
Unfortunately it is rarely that easy.

Creating a data strategy often requires pragmatism. If there is no ground truth data then we need to define it.
If there is no owner, then one must be assigned. If it can not be accessed then we need to review access policys.
Unfortunately one often find this out **after** an AI-level initative has been budgeted.
*That is not how we do things around here*.
You as the person spearheading something like that should do your due diligence.

The hierarchy of data needs is roughly:
* Can you even scrape the data together into one pile? How long does that take?
* Can you gather the data into one place or at least have one hub?
* Is the data reliable enough to report as official numbers?
* Have you built business reporting on top of these numbers?

If data exists and it is good enough for business intelligence, then we have a chance.
If not then one must start with these two steps. 
Of course, one typically want **all** the data for all possible use cases.
The best one can do is to pick a use case or a family of use cases, enable those with data, business intelligence and then do the *fun* stuff.
Although, in my experience, going from no source of truth to one source of truth itself often has great effects.

## 3. "We have too much bread and too little butter"

The quote is of a colleague of mine describing our departments approach to initatives.

Avoiding to spread yourself thin is easier said than done.
It requires both discipline and insights into how your team operates.
What we would like to avoid is a situation where multiple sources of work are attached to every single person.

From experience an individual can at max juggle 7-9 (2-3 medium/big, 5-6 small) things in their head
but that is the limit where congestion hits. 
They will be so bogged down so that the pace of the work that gets done matches the rate of incoming work
or the growth of existing work (interest on your work debt).
This is not a state to be in for longer periods of time.
It leaves little-to-no time for reflection, documentation, robustification, skill development and other non-urgent things.

Below is a graph showcasing this effect on a toy example.
Active tasks accrue interest.
This can be interpreted as scope drift, decreasing motivation over time or the fact that formalities (read: meetings, workshops) have a fixed time budget whileas time spent on progress is flexible (and there is a problem if the formalities take up more time than you have to spend on progress).
In the parallel burndown example we start the three tasks at the same time.
The pace is $\frac{1}{3}$ for each task.
The initially estimated effort is $8 + 5 + 3 = 16$ weeks but it ends up taking 25 weeks!
In the sequential example the tasks are knocked out one at a time, only taking 18 weeks in total.

![...](/images/leadership/leadership_1.png)

This is not a model for real time management as in reality there is probably a goldilock
zone for each individual but the point still stands.
Focus beats context switching and formality overhead for getting things done **fast**.
Of course, it is our responsiblity as leaders to sacrifie some sacred focus time to support others.
After all, helping the team time manage can unlock $\frac{25}{18} \approx 1.39 \rightarrow 39\%$ efficiency! 
(source: the graph above ... joking!)

What are some tools for handling this?
* Prevent it from becoming a problem in the first place.
    * One must dare to say "no" or "later".
    * One must clear out old things stealing time. Do you have any old sourdoughs?
* An individual's tasks can be load-balanced onto colleagues but this is a risky maneuver.
In another colleague start to need offloading then it quickly bogs down the group until they are back up and running.
Instead it is wiser to either pause their work or pause the work of the colleague taking over.
* Task size and interest can be guesstimated. 
    * In an agile context people are usually comfortable with T-shirt sizes (S, M, L, XL) for task size.
    * Interest is harder. It probably correlates with things that makes an S-task feel like a L-task:
        * Are there a lot of formalities?
        * Is there percieved hostility or apathy in the working group?
        * Have the ground work been laid? (like, do you have a data strategy?)
        * Is there a clear path on how to achieve the goal?

In the end this will always be a moving target because external demand and the people in your group fluctuates.

## 4. Sourdough management

Sourdoughs, new and old, is something you are changed with clearing up.
In my mind, letting them grow is *negative* progress.
Work has to be undone before it can progress smoothly again.
The most common sources of sourdoughs are:
* Half-finished projects where almost all resources have been moved on to other tasks.
* Data or software decay due to not having been maintained or even used for a long time.
* Prestudy-purgatory, where people have gotten fed up with the idea before it even reached any level of maturity.
Yet its name keeps showing up on the list of things that are "in the working".
* Technical debt accrued by taking shortcuts when building something. Typically POCs in production.
* Keeping to an old way of doing things or a tool despite the cost outweighing the benefits.
* A project that has developed organically (without a plan) for way too long.
* Something that does not match the roles in your team, but they do anyway.

Being aware of sourdoughs and keeping track of them is key.
It is uncomfortable for some not to think "done is done, what is next?"
and face the fact that what used to be a ✅ is now a ❌.
Taking care of them starts with one question "if we remove this, will it be missed or will everyone involved be *relieved*?"

If it will be missed, then one needs to figure out the plan for adressing it.
While it is tempting to stop all work until the sourdoughs are fixed, 
one often have to solve them simulateneosly as handling new work.
Clearly communicating both inward and outward is important to manage expectations.
The most uncomfortable aspects surrounding sourdough management is the sunk cost fallacy (for the people who invested in it)
and the destruction of capital that working on it has implied.
It is therefore important to educate stakeholders on how to move forward in the future.

## 5. Prodjuect management

Product / project management can start of simple with just a few general guidelines:
* You have failed if your project or product became a sourdough.
* If it is set up to be a sourdough, do not start it.
* Do not start something that is not ready yet.
* Have a continually updated strategy for what will drive impact.
* Discount impact based on how much work will be required (long-term, in perpituity).
* Ask yourself if you have the right team or is it just who was available?
* Formalities should serve the product / project and not the other way around.

A lot of these sound like no-brainers but that is all the more reason to follow them.
