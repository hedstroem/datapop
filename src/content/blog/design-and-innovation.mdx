# Innovation?

In my career I have been part of a lot of *innovative / cutting-edge / research* projects.
Only for most of them to either fail, 
show lukewarm results (soft fail), 
show promise but never move beyond POC
or be forgotten.
The most interesting experience was probably being moved, no, *chosen* into an exclusive "innovation" group within our department...
only for it to last 2 meetings and then never to be brought up again.
I have had idea banks been taken over by senior leaders, only for them to translate them to another system and leave them to gather dust.

Still, not every story ended in failure. 
Some initiatives did succeed - and those made me think hard about what separates genuine innovation from corporate theater.
To start off, summarizing some insights:
* **Innovation is not R\&D**, although they interact and cooperate. 
Process development or effectivization is another bordering topic as it often requires innovating and thinking from first principles / out of the box.
* **Innovation’s rhythm is irregular by design**. 
Innovation is gamble and returns will be irregular. 
This is why innovation is exciting in the first place!
One careful of "systematic innovation" or other corporate oxymorons.
* **Failure is the cost of innovation.** Innovation requires killing projects and ideas. A high success rate means that one is not innovating, merely developing or implementing.
Expect, like with any research, that 70-90% of even seemingly reasonable ideas will fail. 
However, the projects that survive the infant mortality should have a high survival rate!
**The process isn’t sexy — the results are.**

# How does one get started with innovation?

## Innovation requires two things

**Design processes** - The engine that lets you churn out and develop new ideas.\
**Goal:** Create confidence and capability in exploring and solving problems differently.

**Innovation management** - The organization to scale and sustain innovation.\
**Goal:** Make innovation repeatable, measurable, and strategically aligned.

If you’re starting from scratch, begin with design. You can’t manage innovation before you’ve learned to make it.

## Design processes

Two famous processes are the double diamond and Stanford design school 5-step model.
They frame the stages of problem solving wherein we can apply different methods.
The choice of design methods depends of your domain but includes user interviews, studies, 
literature review, customer journeys, creating personas, problem framing, workshoping, 
storyboarding, mind mapping, prototyping, A/B testing, pilot testing.

### Double diamond

The diamonds represent exploration (widening) and exploitation (narrowing).
* Discovery - Get insight into the problem.
* Defining and exploring - Narrow down the scope / focus.
* Develop and test - Explore potential solutions.
* Deliver and listen - Get feedback.

Between the two diamonds there is a natural go or no-go gateway. 

### Standford d-school's 5-step model

There are a lot of similarities to the double diamond.
One can argue that the wording, in particular empathize and test, are more user-centric.
It also splits develop and deliver into ideate, prototype and testing.
[This resource on interaction-design.org](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/5-stages-in-the-design-thinking-process?srsltid=AfmBOoruXVeMeZGhuW-pqoOQ-sXke_8qoiGafGFI1TFuSwEQCRW8Zj_i)
highlights this by showing how prototypes and tests feed into new ideas:

Personally I find that prototyping is a natural part of ideation so therefore I am more inclined to think like the double diamond.
But that is probably a bias from my background in tech and not services or marketing.

## Innovation management

So you have learned to creatively problem solve to unlock new potentials i.e. innovate? Great!

Managing innovation, like managing anything, requires a few puzzle pieces:
* Roles
* Processes
* Governance structure \& decision model
* Metrics
* Tools \& infrastructure
* Cultural \& capability initiatives

For this section we focus on roles, processes and governance.

### Roles

Rather can specifying managerial roles, lets work inversely from the managerial responsibilities:
* Strategy
* Portfolio priorities
* Communication with higher management
* Run portfolio processes
* Metric reporting
* Hiring resources
* Tool \& infrastructure selection
* Team coordination
* Project ownership

Typically one arranges these under:
* **Head (of innovation)** - Strategy + Portfolio priorities + Communication with higher management
* **Program manager** - Run portfolio processes + Metric reporting + Hiring resources
* **(Innovation) Lead(s)** - Team coordination + Project ownership

Tool \& infrastructure selection typically fall on program managers or leads to implement and harmonize.\
The contributor roles typically falls in to:
* **Researcher**
* **Designer**
* **Test, change management or experimentation leaders / coaches**

### Processes

| **Stage**    | **Purpose**                                                | **Key Activities**                                            | **Primary Roles**                                                         | **Supporting Roles**                                                                                                     | **Outputs**                               |

### Governance \& decision model

The purpose of governance is not bureaucracy, but clarity:
* Enable decision-making under uncertainty
* Balance risk and reward across horizons and innovation types (incremental, adjacent, transformational)
* Ensure accountability without stifling experimentation
* Provide transparency on progress, investment, and outcomes

The layers of governance should mirror the roles and processes laid out above:
| **Layer**                                                   | **Description**                                        | **Key Responsibilities**                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Strategic Layer (Leadership / Head of Innovation)**       | Defines overall innovation thesis and strategic intent | Set portfolio direction, approve opportunity spaces, define success criteria, ensure alignment with business goals |
| **Operational Layer (Program Managers / Innovation Leads)** | Runs the innovation portfolio and stage gates          | Manage project pipeline, coordinate resources, track metrics, prepare review materials                             |
| **Execution Layer (Teams / Contributors)**                  | Execute discovery, design, and experimentation         | Conduct research, prototype, test, and iterate within agreed boundaries                                            |
| **Advisory Layer (Innovation Board / Steering Committee)**  | Provides external and cross-functional input           | Validate strategic fit, approve funding transitions, sponsor pilots or spinouts                                    |

Same with the decision model:
| **Stage Gate**     | **Key Decision Question**                                            | **Decision Owner**                      | **Possible Outcomes**                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Frame Gate**     | Does this opportunity align with our strategy?                       | Head of Innovation / Steering Committee | Advance to Discovery / Reframe / Drop |
| **Discovery Gate** | Have we validated user needs and problem framing?                    | Program Manager + Lead                  | Advance to Define / Rework research   |
| **Define Gate**    | Do we have a clear problem and viable ideas to pursue?               | Innovation Board                        | Advance to Develop / Park for later   |
| **Develop Gate**   | Have experiments validated desirability, feasibility, and viability? | Program Manager + Head of Innovation    | Advance to Deliver / Iterate          |
| **Delivery Gate**  | Is the solution ready for transition to core business?               | Leadership / Product Owner              | Handover / Spinout / Stop             |
| **Reflect Gate**   | Have we captured learning and updated playbooks?                     | Program Manager                         | Institutionalize learnings            |

Practical tools for managing innovation:
* Innovation Portfolio Dashboard – visibility into status, balance, and impact of all initiatives
* Stage-Gate Templates – standardized documentation for learning summaries
* Innovation Playbook – codified decision criteria, roles, and review cadences
* Learning Logs / Experiment Trackers – traceability of insights and validation steps
