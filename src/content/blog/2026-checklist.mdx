# Ask yourself if these apply

### $\tau$ - Be mindful of your time. 

Don't let others waste it. You do not want to be stuck.

Consider time tracking, preferably using a tool with a calendar view.

Remind others that your time matter.
Show them the costs.


### $\Delta$ - Do not build anything that has to be rebuilt

Too much time has been wasted building solutions that only adds noise to the totality.


### $\sigma$ - Do not compensate for poor planning with ad-hoc problem solving

Let planning failures surface instead of patching them over.


### $\Omega$ - Demand clarity - do not accept vague tasks

One wants to avoid accepting a task and end up filling multiple roles.

Also adresses $\Delta$, $\sigma$ and long term $\tau$.


### $\alpha$ - Demand to know the (expected) outcome

Why are we doing this? Can you be sold on the "why"? Otherwise, don't.

Same goes for your role. Is there any point in you doing what you do?


### $\gamma$ - Know your place

Ask yourself: "Must I go in here and save the day?".

Remember the overlap between:
1. What I can do
2. What I want to do
3. What the business values

You can sacrifice 2. but then it needs to be worth it ($\alpha$).

### $\phi$ - Who should I help?

Figure it out. Apply your know-how and learn how you can reduce friction meaningfully.
