This leave the nudge factor as a parameter. Here is a graph of the median estimations applied to Gaussian noise with two different nudges:\n\n![Two incremental median estimations](/images/incremental_median/inc_1.png)\n\nNote that nudge = 0.1 makes the estimate converge quicker than nudge = 0.01, but, the trade-off is that it is also more sensitive to noise. So, what is a good nudge factor?\n\nOne way is to approach is heuristically; say that we expect the estimator to approximately reach the median in M steps. \nSince the median is the 50th percentile; a worst case scenario where we start at the min or max means that we have to step 50 percentage units. \nThis means that we could choose $\\frac{max(max - median,\\: median - min)}{M}$ as the nudge factor. \nSince we do not know the median we can use the range $R = max - min$ as an upper bound $\\frac{R}{M}$. This is an extreme scenario where the median is close to either the min or max.\nFor the uniform scenario where the median lies dead in the middle between min and max it is twice as big, so then we will get to our estimate in $\\frac{M}{2}$ steps.\n\n![Incrementally estimating max and min](/images/incremental_median/inc_2.png)\n\nWith this method we have a bit more control, as can be seen in the following graph:\n\n![Comparison of different R/M nudges](/images/incremental_median/inc_3.png)\n\nEyeballing this particular example gives the M = 30, 16 steps and M = 120, 91 steps to get to the sample median. \nNow, there additional steps we can take to ensure a fair(er) nudging toward the median and it relates to $R$.\nWe do not expect our estimate of R to be close to the truth after only 3 or 10 observations, so what do we expect it to be and can we correct for that?\n\nFor $n$ samples selected uniformly on the interval [0,1) the expectation of the maximum is $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ and the minimum is $\\frac{1}{n+1}$.\nThis means the expectation of the range is\n$$\nE(R|n) = \\frac{n}{n+1} - \\frac{1}{n+1} = \\frac{n-1}{n+1}.\n$$\n\nThe intuition behind this is that $n$ samples split the line into $n+1$ sections and ordering them by size gives $1$ and $n$ as the first and final sections.\nOf course, our data is not likely uniformly distributed, but the quantiles are by definition.\nThis means that after, for example $n = 9$, we would have expected to seen 10% and 90% percentile with an 80 percentile range.\nBy $n = 99$ we will have seen from the 1st to the 99th percentile and subsequently the $n = 999$ sample gives us 0.001 to 0.999 quantile.\nThere are two take-aways from this observation.\n\nThe first is that we can invert the formula $R = \\frac{n-1}{n+1} \\rightarrow n = -\\frac{R+1}{R-1}$.\nThis is handy if we are looking for a specific quantile $q$, it corresponds to the range $R_q = 1-2q$ and by our formula $n = \\frac{1-q}{q}$. \nThis only makes sense for $q \u003C 0.5$ so for $q > 0.5$ we find its mirrored buddy $\\tilde{q} = 1 - q$. \nNow, specifically for the median this collapses to $n = 1$ but if we are going to look at any quantile then this will come in handy.\nIn essence, this estimate of $n$ will tell you when we it is likely to have seen the quantile we are estimating.\n\nThe second take away is that we can use the formula to create a better estimate $R_n$ out of our naive incremental $R$ as $R_n = \\frac{R}{\\frac{n-1}{n+1}} = \\frac{R(n+1)}{n-1}$. \nThis means that the range will scaled up to conpensate for likely unobserved range. This means that the full nudge heuristic is now $\\frac{R(n+1)}{M(n-1)}$. \nSee two examples below of the difference, one cherry-picked (note that the correction is only relevant when we need the nudges to be large) and one regular:\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_median/inc_4.png\",\n      alt: \"Improved convergence example 1\",\n      caption: \"Cherry-picked example\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_median/inc_5.png\",\n      alt: \"Improved convergence example 2\",\n      caption: \"Regular convergence\"\n    },\n  ]}\n  columns={2}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nIt is not much but it is something.\n\nThe elephant in the room are the variations in the estimate. \nSince we are observing random noise the estimates will follow the random sequences of nudges like a random walk.\nWhat we know about random walks of $n$ steps is that the expectation $E(\\mathcal{Z}_n) = 0$ with the variance $E(\\mathcal{Z}_n^2) = n$.\nSo if we have a random walk then we would expect the standard deviation to grow like $\\sqrt{n}$, meaning that we should shrink the nudges to compensate for this effect.\nOf course, we would only apply this after $M$ steps, when we have actually expected to converge to the median.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_median/inc_6.png\",\n      alt: \"Test of random walk penalty of the nudge amplitude\",\n      caption: \"Example 1: Gaussian\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_median/inc_7.png\",\n      alt: \"Test of random walk penalty of the nudge amplitude on an exponential distribution\",\n      caption: \"Example 2: Exponential\"\n    },\n  ]}\n  columns={2}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nBut, our system is not a true random walk because is it still an approximation of the median, so it will have some drift towards the true distribution median. \nSay that we are targeting the $q_t$ quantile (0.5 in case of the median) with $dq$ nudges (0.1 for our example) of our estimate $q$. \nIf $q = q_t$ then we have a 50/50 of being nudged in either direction, say + happens, then we are at $q + dq$. \nThis has now shifted the probabilities as we now have a 40/60 chance in favor of going back towards $q_t$.\nIf + happens again then we are at $q + 2dq$, meaning now a 30/70 chance next time. \nThe most extreme scenario has $dq = q_t$ when $q_t = 0.5$ as it always reverses its previous step, meaning that the distribution is 0: 25%, $q_t$: 50%, 1: 25%.\n\nOf course, we want to be able to assume any $dq$. \nTo get an intution behind this we simulated using $dq = \\frac{1}{50}$ and noted that is approximated a Gaussian distribution.\nIn the limit where $dq \\rightarrow 0$ it makes sense because then the drift back towards the median is less dominant. \n![Histogram of quantile estimations](/images/incremental_median/inc_8.png)\n\nWe run more experiments with different fractions of $\\frac{dq}{q_t}$, calculate the standard deviation, resulting in:\n![Experiments logging standard deviation of quantile estimations as a function of dq/qt](/images/incremental_median/inc_9.png)\n\nThe curve fitting is easy as it is a square root of the fraction and $x = 0.5$ neatly intersects $y = 0.25$. \nThis means that empirically we have arrived at the rubber band random walk standard deviation $\\sigma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\sqrt{\\frac{dq}{q_t}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{dq}{8q_t}}$. \nNote that this does not depend on $n$, which we conjectured above. \nSimiarly to what we have done before, we can shuffle expressions around to find the fraction given a target standard deviation $\\sigma$ as $\\frac{dq}{q_t} = 8\\sigma^2$.\nIf we were to calibrate a 95% confidence interval ($\\pm 1.96\\sigma$) over $\\pm 1$ percentiles ($\\rightarrow \\sigma = \\frac{0.01}{1.96}$) then $\\frac{dq}{q_t} \\approx 0.00021 \\rightarrow dq = 1/9604$ ($q_t = 0.5$).\nFor a more liberal $\\pm 2.5$ percentiles $\\frac{dq}{q_t} \\approx 0.0013 \\rightarrow dq = 1/1536.64$.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_median/inc_10.png\",\n      alt: \"Example 1 of random walk confidence interval nudges\",\n      caption: \"Example 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_median/inc_11.png\",\n      alt: \"Example 2 of random walk confidence interval nudges\",\n      caption: \"Example 2\"\n    },\n  ]}\n  columns={2}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nThat has (kind-of) solved it!

'../../components/ImageGallery.astro';\n\nThis post continues from the incremental median estimation.\n\nTo estimate any quantile instead of the median one adds a bias to the sign of the nudge.\nWhat does this represent? \nConsider the case of the 90th percentile, if our estimate is accurate then we expect 90% of the incoming observations to be below the estimate.\nThis means that the 90 / 10 split must be the equilibrium between the 90% downward nudges and 10% upward nudges.\nThe bias $b = 1 - 2q$ for the 90% percentile is $b = -0.8$, this means that a positive sign $\\rightarrow 0.2$ and a negative $\\rightarrow -1.8$.\nIf we multiply these nudges by their frequency we see that they are in balance: $0.9 \\cdot 0.2 + 0.1 \\cdot -1.8 = 0.18 - 0.18 = 0$.\n\nOne thing to note is that the average absolute nudge is $0.18 + 0.18 = 0.36$, which is lower than $\\|0.5 \\cdot 1\\| + \\|0.5 \\cdot -1\\| = 1.0$ for the median.\nThis means that if we use a bias we also want to scale the size of the nudge by the inverse of $s_b = 4\\tilde{q}(1-\\tilde{q})$ where $\\tilde{q} = min(q, 1-q)$. \nThis means that an updated algorithm can be written as:\n\n```python\ndef update_quantile_estimate(\n        quantile_to_estimate: float,\n        quantile_estimate: float, \n        observation: float, \n        nudge: float\n    ) -> float:\n    bias = 1 - 2 * quantile_to_estimate\n    q_tilde = min(quantile_to_estimate, 1-quantile_to_estimate)\n    scale_bias = 4*q_tilde*(1-q_tilde)\n    diff = quantile_estimate - observation\n    sign = diff / abs(diff)\n    new_quantile_estimate = quantile_estimate - nudge * (sign + bias) / scale_bias\n    return new_quantile_estimate\n```\n\nThe nudges can utilize the same schema as for the median $\\frac{R(n+1)}{M(n-1)}$ for quick converge.\nBut the rubber band random walk confidence interval $\\frac{dq}{\\tilde{q_t}q_t} = 8\\sigma^2$ that we empirically derived is no longer applicable.\nOn top of the rubber band (pulling us toward the quantile estimate when we drift to far) and the random walk (because the observations are random in nature) aspects, we also now have a drift (bias) to account for.\n\nAfter repeating the experiment for different values of $q$ and refit the function we find that actually $\\frac{dq}{\\tilde{q_t}} = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{\\tilde{q_t}}$.\nThis means that $dq$ is actually $q$-invariant and that the simplified formula gives $dq = 4\\sigma^2$ and that the $\\pm 2.5$ percentile CI $\\rightarrow M = 1536.4$ is universal.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src:

\"Example of incremental quantile estimation\"\n    }\n  ]}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nNote that the $q = 0.01$ quantile looks a bit jumpy and $q = 0.999$ even more so. \nThat is because we have so few observations, meaning that the nudges become highly unbalanced.\nAnother factor is the fact that we used $\\pm 2.5$ percentile confidence interval for something like the 1st percentile.\nSo we accept quite a lot of noise in our estimate.\nHere is how the estimation of $q = 0.999$ looks for 10000 observations:\n\n![Example of incremental quantile estimation](/images/incremental_quantile/incremental_quantile_6.png)\n\nIf one counts the upward jumps one gets 11, which is close to the expected value of $(1-0.999) \\cdot 10000 = 10$.\nThere are some potential remedies for this, the first one is to adjust the confidence interval to match the quantile.\nThis would mean that $dq = 4\\sigma^2 = 4(\\frac{0.001}{1.96})^2 = \\frac{1}{960400}$.\nThis first approach will do the trick but it will take forever to converge.\n\nThe second potential remedy is just a sanity check. *Why are we allowing the quantile estimate to go beyond our maximum or minimum observed value?*\nThis was not a problem for the median estimation but here it is clearly an issue.\nBy bounding the estimate one gets something that looks like this.\n![Example of incremental quantile estimation](/images/incremental_quantile/incremental_quantile_7.png)\n\nHowever, this leaves an issue on how to deal with the excess as it is required to balance the downward nudges.\nIf one allows the excess to carry over and nullify the opposite nudges then one ends up with flat segments like this.\n![Example of incremental quantile estimation](/images/incremental_quantile/incremental_quantile_8.png)\n\nNeither of these are that satisfactory because they do not solve the jumpiness at its core.\nWe should also state that the extreme quantiles are something we will rarely need.\nLet us focus on another aspect of quantile estimation and we might be able to resove the issue in another way.\n\nThe jumpiness fundamentally comes from our frequentist approach to estimating the quantiles.\nTo approach the problem from a Bayesian point of view we can attempt correct our frequentist estimator $\\hat{q}$.\nThe $\\pm$ signs $x_i$ around our estimator $\\hat{q}$ follow a Bernoulli distribution $x_1, ..., x_n \\sim$ Bernoulli($p$). \nThe beta distribution $\\beta(a,b)$ is a conjugate prior distribution to Bernoulli($p$).\nThe posterior distibution becomes $p\\:|\\:x_1, ..., x_n \\sim \\beta(a + s,b + t)$, where $s$ are the number of successes and $t$ the total number of observations.\nThis means that $E(p\\:|\\:x_1, ..., x_n) = \\frac{a + s}{a + b + t}$.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_quantile/incremental_quantile_9.png\",\n      alt: \"Example of

example below we shift from $x \\sim N(0, 1)$ to $x \\sim N(2,1)$ after 1000 steps.\nThe estimates do follow along but the jaggedness is back.\nThis is because our Bayesian estimator is cumulative and it will therefore take a long time before those initial 1000 steps become neglible.\n\n![Shifted distribution](/images/incremental_quantile/incremental_quantile_22.png)\n\nA way to speed things up is to add a \"forgetting factor\" $\\lambda$ to the cumulative $s$ and $t$.\nBecause our quantile rate of change is $dq$ we define the forgetting factor $\\lambda = (1-c \\cdot dq)$.\nThis means that the forgetting matches the inertia induced by our desired confidence interval.\nSay that we want to forget 90% within one $\\frac{1}{dq}$ observations, \nsolving the expression $0.1 = (1 - c \\cdot dq)^\\frac{1}{dq} \\rightarrow c = \\frac{1 - e^{dq \\cdot log(0.1)}}{dq}$,\nwhich for our typical confidence interval means $c \\approx 2.3$.\nPutting this back into our forgetting factor simplifies the solution $\\lambda = (1- \\frac{1 - e^{dq \\cdot log(0.1)}}{dq} \\cdot dq) = e^{dq \\cdot log(0.1)}$.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src:

ImageGallery from '../../components/ImageGallery.astro';\n\nWhile finishing up the last post on incremental quantile estimation got intrigued by the Bayesian estimator.\nIt can basically verify any method, so the question is if one can make a simpler (and more robust) approach than the nudger?\nTo strengthen my intuition I ran an experiment where one takes the first 10 observations and estimate their quantiles.\nThe quantile we measure our error towards is $q = 0.9$.\n\n![...](/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_1.png)\n\nNotice that the 0 error line is between the yellow observation 5 (=1.64) and blue observation 0 (=1.01).\nThis is also where we find the red sample quantile.\nNow, what to do with this information?\nEither one can start throwing away the lousy estimates for better ones (like, in between the blue and yellow), or one can be smarter about their initial selection.\n\nTo address the latter.\nRemember from the previous posts that one expects to see the range $R$ after $n$ observations $R = (n-1)/(n+1)$.\nThis also meant that one had to wait until $n = \\frac{1-\\tilde{q}}{\\tilde{q}}$ where $\\tilde{q} = min(q, 1-q)$\nto match the expected range of observed quantiles. \nSo for our example $q = 0.9 \\rightarrow n = 9$ we basically already did this.\nHowever, with this reasoning we should pick our first observation as our median estimate and that does not always work out.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_2.png\",\n      alt: \"Using the first observation to

median\"\n    }\n  ]}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nSo there is clearly some value in having more than 1 observation in order to learn something more about the spread of quantiles.\nProbably the more the merrier but we are interested in small solutions, so $n = $ 2, 3, 5 or even 10 would be nice.\nTo make our task easier to manage we can start by giving ourselves a calibration window $w$ where we get to pick our $n$ observations.\n\nOne thing to keep track of if $w \u003C \\frac{1-\\tilde{q}}{\\tilde{q}}$. \nIn that case we know that our estimate is the maximum or minimum observation times a factor $\\delta$ for the potentially missing range $\\delta = \\frac{R_q}{R_w} = (1-2\\tilde{q})\\frac{w+1}{w-1}$.\nFor the case where we have seen the observed the range we can sort the observations and pick out the quantile estimate from there.\nOf course, that would require us to buffer the observations, in which case we might as well call $n = w$.\nThen we pick the ith indexed observations in a sorted list which matches our quantile (for $q = 0.9$ we pick the 9th out of 10), then we pick $\\pm 1$ indices around it and cram out estimates into that range.\nThis does not work out that nice as can be seen below:\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_5.png\",\n      alt: \"Using the first $n$ observations to estimate a

and instead consider another dimension of our estimate, *how long does it take until we can trust it?*\nFor both the median and $q = 0.9$ it seems to take at least 100 observations before the Bayesian estimate stabilizes.\nThis is also a limitation to be way of because it means that we can not shuffle our observations around and reseting the Bayesian estimates too often.\n\nAnother fact that to note is the **correlation** between the quantile estimation errors. \nThis is because they are estimated using the same random sequence of observations.\nFor two observations $y_1, y_2$ that are close to each other $\\Delta y = |y_2-y_1| \u003C\u003C 1$ this means that differentiating between the two would require an observation that lies between them.\nThis means that one probably want to randomly drop observations to avoid correlation in the estimates and that one wants to estimate relatively distinct observations.\n\nFor a dropout probability of 50%:\n\n![...](/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_8.png)\n\nSo, back to the algorithm crafting. \nIf we start with the first $M$ observations that we did before (better not try to be clever).\nThe next step is after $W$ observations to reset the observations based on what we have learned.\nIf we take a look at the quantile estimation errors vs the observation values at $n = 100$ we have the following scatter plot.\n\n![...](/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_9.png)\n\nFor this example we do not even have an observation on either side of the 0.\nThis means that the method we use need to extrapolate.\nA linear regression will do a decent job for this example.\nHowever, even this demo distribution (Gaussian) is not linear as it is only linear-ish.\nTherefore multiple shooting is required to narrow down the interval of shooting.\n\nOne important choice will be the how to take the linear regression $y = kx + m$ and use that information.\nThe most likely position of the quantile is the intercept $m$ but only one estimate can have that position.\nWe also know that we do not want to agressively cluster the estimates either.\nA fair initial assumption is to assume some $\\pm \\Delta q$ interval, like $\\pm 0.1$ quantiles or $\\pm 0.05$ quantiles.\nThis means that for $W = 100$, $M = 10$, $\\Delta q = 0.1$ every 100 observations we will reset the estimates to $(-0.1, -0.0\\bar{7}, -0.0\\bar{5}, ..., 0.1)$ quantile errors according to a linear fit of error and observations.\nThe result for a few different $\\Delta q$ can be seen below.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_10.png\",\n      alt: \"Using the first $n$ observations

value unlike $\\pm 0.05$ and $\\pm 0.01$ quantiles.\nAnother observation is that $\\Delta q = 0.1$ collapses to a single value for the median, so that property is dependent on $q$.\n\n![...](/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_13.png)\n\nHere is what its corresponding linear fit looks like. \nIt basically collapses into a ball where quantiles and estimates no longer correlate.\nThis is a symptom of what we disussed before, longer periods are needed to differentiate between the points.\nIt is also information if we do not get a positive slope, because by definition it should always be positive.\n\n![...](/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_14.png)\n\nBy doubling the $W$ we give the observations more time to converge, avoiding collapse for the median.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_15.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"Doubling the

the intercept $m$, then lets just make our new batch of estimates $y_{i,new} = (1-\\gamma) y_{i,old} + \\gamma m$ where $y_i$ is the $i$th observation.\nThis keeps the behavior of the median the same and also makes $q = 0.9$ more sensible. See the difference below for the same data.\nIn this example $\\gamma = 0.5$, which seems to be a good compromise between converge and keeping the spread of estimates.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_17.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"Linear model\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_18.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"Smoothing model\"\n    }\n  ]}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nOf course, this method runs the risk of getting stuck below or over the estimate. \nThis tends to happen if all the $M$ initializing observations are on one side of the quantile $q$ we are trying to estimate. \nIf our estimations are biased (one-sided), we should correct for it as $y_{i,new} = (1-\\gamma) y_{i,old} + \\gamma m - \\gamma bias$,\nwhere the $bias = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^{M} (q - y_i)$ and $y_i$ are estimates.

Instead we are relying on our initial $M$.\nWe are also using pretty aggressive reset windows, we would not expect to see a $q = 0.999$ observation within $W = 100, 200, ...$.\nIt is also possible to play around with the bias correction and convert it to PI-regulator, meaning that we accumulate biases over time.\nAnother way would also be to amplify the bias factor when $q$ is close to 0 or 1, effectively adding a P-factor. \n\nA few combined steps include:\n* Track the min $a$ and max $b$.\n* Make sure the slope $k \\geq 0$.\n* Scale the bias by $k$ as $y_{i,new} = (1-\\gamma) y_{i,old} + \\gamma (m -  \\cdot k \\cdot bias)$.\n* Calculate the $\\Delta y_{overstep} = max(0, max_i(y_{i,new}) - b)$ and $\\Delta y_{understep} = min(0, min_i(y_{i,new}) - a)$.\n* Adjust the estimates by any overstep or understep $y_{i,adj} = y_{i,new} - \\Delta y_{overstep} - \\Delta y_{understep}$.\n\nThis is basically a sanity check (are we outside of bounds) and using the slope which should be the correct P-factor.\nIt is not a perfect solve as can be observed by the third example in the graphs below.\nThe weirdness seems to appear if we are unfortunate enough to put all of our estimates above the true quantile.\nThis can potentially be mitigated but similarly to the previous posts, lets reserve extreme quantiles for later.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_30.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"q = 0.99 with proposed k * bias and over/understep correction\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_31.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"q = 0.99 with proposed k * bias and over/understep correction\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/incremental_quantile_2/incremental_quantile_2_32.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"q = 0.99 with proposed k * bias and over/understep correction\"\n    }\n  ]}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nLet's write down the algorithm so far:\n\n```python\ndef linear_regression(x, y):\n    n = len(x)\n    xm = sum(x) / n\n    ym = sum(y) / n\n    variance = sum((x - xm)**2)\n    covariance = sum((x - xm)*(y - ym))\n    slope = covariance / variance\n    intercept = ym - slope * xm\n    return slope, intercept\n\ndef estimate_quantiles(\n        data: np.array, \n        quantile: float,\n        number_of_estimators: int = 10,\n        dropout_probability: float = 0.5,\n        reset_window: int = 100,\n        reset_window_scaling: float = 2,\n        update_factor: float = 0.5\n    ) -> np.array:\n    '''\n    This function takes an array of observations, \n    treats them as streaming data and incrementally \n    estimates the q quantile.

While researching this topic I also found this [article of comparative setups of\nlinear models, generalized linear models, additative models and generalized additative models](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~yinlou/papers/lou-kdd12.pdf).\nBasically, these models will never beat your average black box model (the article compares to Random Forests TM).\nBut they do offer some unique interpretability.\n\nMy implementation was in Pytorch and used 1 layer multilayer perceptrons instead of splines or trees.\nThe model fitting was not done using backfitting but rather gradient descent.\n\n```python\ndef create_weights(n_in, n_out):\n    scale = ((6 / (n_in + n_out))**0.5)\n    return scale*2*(torch.rand(n_in, n_out)-0.5)\n\nclass univariate_nllr_model(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(\n            self, \n            n_input, \n            n_hidden = 10, \n            activation_function = nn.Tanh(),\n            loss_function = nn.MSELoss()\n        ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.hidden_nodes_weights = nn.Parameter(create_weights(n_input, n_hidden))\n        self.hidden_nodes_bias = nn.Parameter(create_weights(n_input, n_hidden))\n        self.aggregration_weights = nn.Parameter(create_weights(n_input, n_hidden))\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(n_input, 1)\n        self.activation_function = activation_function\n        self.loss_function = loss_function\n        self.double()\n        \n    def f(self, x):\n        hidden = self.activation_function(\n            x.unsqueeze(2) * self.hidden_nodes_weights + self.hidden_nodes_bias\n        )\n        return (hidden * self.aggregration_weights).sum(-1)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.linear(self.f(x)).squeeze(1)\n    \n    def evaluate(self, x, y, l2_last_layer = 1e-3):\n        fx = self.f(x)\n        yp = self.linear(fx).squeeze(1)\n        loss = self.loss_function(y, yp)\n        if l2_last_layer:\n            loss += l2_last_layer * ((self.linear.weight**2).sum() + (self.linear.bias**2).sum())\n        return loss\n```\n\nFor a toy problem where $x_{1,2,3,4,5} \\sim N(0,1)$ and $y = \\frac{5}{1 + e^{-2x_1}} + 3e^{-x_2^2}$ one gets the following $w_i f_i(x_i)$:\n![...](/images/nonlinear_linear_regression/nllr_1.png)\n\nOf course these are nice smooth functions that fits the tanh activation function well. \n\nThis is what ReLU looks like ($n_{hidden} = 10$):\n![...](/images/nonlinear_linear_regression/nllr_2.png)\n\nRegardless, playing around with the MLP parameters (layer size, depth, activation functions, regularization) will determine the ability of the $f_i(x_i)$ transformation.\nOne can also regularize $f_i(x_i)$ to make sure that uninteresting features (2, 3, 4 in this example) becomes close to zero.\n\nIf we take a real dataset, like the concrete compressive strength dataset [available here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/165/concrete+compressive+strength).\nThe goal is to predict the strength as measured in MPa using different blends of concrete. \nUsing 32 hidden neurons in 1 layer to learn the nonlinearities yields for different activation functions:\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/nonlinear_linear_regression/nllr_3.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"Tanh activation function, training MSE\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/nonlinear_linear_regression/nllr_4.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"Tanh activation function, learned nonlinearities\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/nonlinear_linear_regression/nllr_5.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"ReLU activation function, training MSE\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/nonlinear_linear_regression/nllr_6.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"ReLU activation function, learned nonlinearities\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/nonlinear_linear_regression/nllr_7.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"Sin activation function, training MSE\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/nonlinear_linear_regression/nllr_8.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"Sin activation function, learned nonlinearities\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/nonlinear_linear_regression/nllr_9.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"Binary step activation function, training MSE\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/nonlinear_linear_regression/nllr_10.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"Binary step activation function, learned nonlinearities\"\n    },\n  ]}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nFirst of all, one would typically not use sine or binary step as activation functions in neural nets.\nThey do yield some interesting observations. The sine seems to overfit and come up with some interleaving effects. \nThe binary finds almost nothing but two effects.\n\n| Activation | MSE | No effect fields | Comment |\n| -------- | ------- |  ------- | ------- |\n| tanh | 53.3 | Coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, water, fly ash | Increasing cement generally makes it stronger. Superplasticizer and age both have a tapering effect. Slag has a minor effect. |\n| ReLU | 48.6 | - | Same cement, age and slag observations from tanh. Excessive water has a negative effect. Superplasticizer appears to even have a negative effect after its initial usefulness. |\n| sin | 31.2 | - | Age, superplasticizer and water behave the same as ReLU. Cement is a shared observation but aggregates are slight down in excessive amounts. Slag also seems to have no effect on the whole.|\n| Binary step | 159.2 | All except age and superplasticizer | When we remove nuanced expressions from the model and study on-off effects one only captures effects from superplasticizer and age. |\n\nThe linear(ish) observations seem to be:\n* Higher cement content means a stronger concrete.\n* Avoid excessive superplasticizer and water.\n* 30 to 90 days to cure.\n\nSurely there are cross-effects and trade-offs that one does when balancing a recipe for concrete.\nFor example more cement does require more water and superplasticizer is make the concrete workable for higher cement content in the absence of water.\nThis type of model does not answer that unless we add those factors explicitly.\nBut if where are truly interested in learning more about concrete then there are better models.\n\nComing back to the topic of nonlinear linear models.\nThe downside of my approach is that there are no confidence bounds...\nThat said, as I was writing this, then I looked closer at the article from before and found that they do theirs using bootstrapping.\nSo then it does not really count.\n\nHowever, when working with generalized linear models one can work with proper distributions in a Bayesian fashion.\nWe do lose that feature nonlinearity but itstead we gain how the linear coefficients distribute.\n\nOf course, another way to approach these problem is to take a truly black-box model such as a neural network or boosted trees,\nand try to figure out which patterns in the data it reacts to.\nThat is where one would turn to

update: \n\u003Cbr>*Turns out that SHAP has a gradient-based explainer, we will compare and reason about it* :)\u003C/br>\n\nIf we implemented a simple, dense univarate neural network in Pytorch like

y\n```\n\nAnd throw a problem at it like this\n $x_{1,2,3,4,5,6,7} \\sim N(0,1)$ and $y = \\frac{5}{1 + e^{-2x_1}} + 3e^{-x_2^2} + x_3x_4$.\n\n![...](/images/sensitivity/sens_1.png)\n\nGiven that we store our $x_i$ in a matrix $X$ and targets in a column vector $y$. \nThen one can calculate the gradient of the model output by $\\pm 1$ unit with regards to $x_i$ using`torch.autograd.grad`for Pytorch.\nOne note is that one needs to copy the input data and make it require a gradient for this calculation to work.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nX_grad = X.clone().requires_grad_()\ngrad = torch.autograd.grad(\n    model.forward(X_grad), \n    X_grad, \n    torch.ones_like(y)\n)\n```\n\nWith this we have received an $n \\times m$ matrix where each element is $\\frac{\\partial{y}}{\\partial{x_i}}(k)$,\nwhere $k$ is our row index.\nUsing this derivative of the model at every observation, we can look at things like the average power per feature.\nThis hints at which of the signals the model things are strong contender for nudging the target.\n\n![...](/images/sensitivity/sens_2.png)\n\nIt is a simple feature importance but it has done the trick.\nNote that there was a cross-effect between $x_3x_4$, \nthe question is if that can be found when analyzing the gradients.\nBy doing principal component analysis (PCA) on the gradients we find four components.\nThe rest PC5, PC6, PC7 just capture noise.\n\n![...](/images/sensitivity/sens_3.png)\n\nAnd by looking at the weights of the components we find that PC1 belongs to $x2$, PC4 belongs to $x_1$ but PC2 and PC3 references both $x_3$ and $x_4$.\nThe first time (PC2) they both have positive weight and the second time (PC3) they positive-negative weights. \nPerhaps this hints at the underlying relationship.\nMaybe it does not specifically.\n\n![...](/images/sensitivity/sens_4.png)\n\nHere are the corresponding SHAP values using the official library:\n```python\nimport

than $x_2$, \nwhen the size of the gradients say the opposite.\nThe SHAP values are indeed correct when it comes to feature importance.\nThe MSE increases to 70 when $x_1$ is blocked out while it only increases to 30 for $x_2$.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/sensitivity/sens_6.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"x1 excluded from training\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/sensitivity/sens_7.png\",\n      alt: \"...\",\n      caption: \"x2 excluded from training\"\n    },\n  ]}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nSo feature importance != sensitivity.\nThe gradients tell us something about how to probe the model to change the output.\nIn this case prodding $x_2$ has a better marginal effect than $x_1$.\nHowever, it does not (yet) tell us how removing this parameter would hurt the model.\nFor $x_5, x_6, x_7$ we have learned that lack of sensitivity can be interpreted as feature uninportance.\n\nTo my understanding the SHAP gradient explainer starts by sampling a subset of the data, called the baseline observations $x'$.\nTo calculate the SHAP value $\\phi_i$ for feature $i$ of observation $x_i[k]$ \none calculates the path integral of the gradient from $x_i[k]$ to each baseline $x_i'$\nand then averages over the baselines.\nThe points along the path are parametrized using $\\alpha$ as $x_{\\alpha}'[k] = x' - \\alpha (x[k] - x')$\n$$$\n\\phi_i[k] = (x_i[k] - x'_i)\\int_{\\alpha = 0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial f(x_{\\alpha}'[k])}{\\partial x_i} d\\alpha.\n$$$\n\nTo make life easy for our implementation we can approximate the integral $\\int_0^1 f(x) dx \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^h \\frac{1}{h}f(x+\\frac{i}{h})$.\nThis gives us our own homebrew SHAP values.\nOf course, it is not identical to the real SHAP library. They probably have a much nicer implementation.\n\n![...](/images/sensitivity/sens_8.png)\n\nSo how does this work? Well, basically we are interested in feature importance.\nThe simplest way to answer that question would be just run leave-one-out and document where model performance tanks.\nFor the SHAP values to become large, signaling feature importance, two things must happen:\n1. The path must have some variation in the feature $i$, otherwise $x_i[k] - x'_i = 0$.\n2. The gradient should be consistently positive or negative so that the magnitude of the integral grows.\nThe means that not only must the gradient be stable for changes in feature $i$ but also other features along the path.\nThis might also explain why we see $x_3$ and $x_4$ cluster closer to zero as their effect is dependent.\n\nThe second (messy) observation is related to [this nice post on SHAP titled \"Be careful when intrepreting predictive models in search of causal insights.](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/overviews/Be%20careful%20when%20interpreting%20predictive%20models%20in%20search%20of%20causal%20insights.html)\nIt essentially states that SHAP values to not infer causality and they show this with a nice subscriber retention example.\nIn their example there are both measured and unmeasured confounding features, both causing skewed insights regarding discounts and ad spend.\n\nTo verify that the neural net suffers from the same issues we recreate the dataset, train a classifier neural net and calculate its gradients.\nBecause care about the directionality of our gradients we average instead of looking at the power. \nThis gives us the aggregated sensivity in the bar chart below:\n\n![...](/images/sensitivity/sens_9.png)\n\nIndeed, it suffers from the same problem as highlighted by their example.\nSo... feature importance and sensitivity analys can be bogus if the causality is whack.\nWhat can be done about this?\nThe article talks about the double-ML approach for observed cofounders, which is the case for ad spend.\nThe steps are:\n1. Train a model to predict ad spend using possible confounders.\n2. Train a model to predict the target (did renew) using the same set of possible confounders.\n3. Train a model to predict the residual of 2. using the residual from 1.\n\nUsing this methodology one finds that there is no additional information in ad spend after what has been predicted from the confounders.\nThe article also mentions redudancy which is a problem of sales calls as a subset of interactions.\nThis means that the model thinks that sales calls are redudant for the modeling but the simplest way to test this is to simply fit a univariate model.\nFor unobserved confounders however, like product need which influences discount, we are out of luck.\nThe article talks about experimental design to identify the true causal nature.\n\nAll of this has inspired me to dive into causal modeling in my next post.\n\nAnother thing to also reflect upon; now we have only looked inwards at the models but another approach is simulation.\nThis is what sensivitity-analysis-through-probing frameworks do. It is often referred to what-if simulations,\nwhich can act as basis of decision for policy or in a control loop.\n\nHowever, with what we have learned about models missing causality or lacking confidence \none understands that it is never as simple as \"train a model and start using it\".\nA lot of effort can be put towards understanding a problem, models of it and the failure modes of those models.","src/content/blog/sensitivity-analysis.mdx","5d540ef3a7db69e8","sensitivity-analysis.mdx","causal-modeling",{"id":82,"data":84,"body":90,"filePath":91,"digest":92,"legacyId":93,"deferredRender":24},{"title":85,"description":86,"pubDate":87,"tags":88},"Learning about causal modeling","Notes on my random walk of causal modeling and the PyWhy ecosystem",["Date","2025-08-29T00:00:00.000Z"],[89],"notetaking","The only thing I knew about causal modeling before I wrote this post is the double ML check. \nIt is the method for checking observed confounders.\nI have had to use it in my work because a manager approached us with the question \"Does net promoter score (eNPS) correlate with accident statistics?\"\n\nFor those of you who do not know, net promoter score is a question \"Would you recommend this company to an acquaintance?\" on a scale of 1-10.\nIf you pick 6 or below you are a detractor, if you pick 9 or 10 then you are a promoter, 7 and 8s do not count.\nThe score is calculated as $eNPS = \\%promoters - \\%detractors$.\n\neNPS is a touchy subject that managers are usually encouraged to increase, often without clear methods or expected results.\nTherefore, the question itself becomes quite convoluted when you think about what this manager is asking for,\n\"Is this looking to strengthen the eNPS-higher-equals-better narrative?\" or is it simply that understanding accident statistics is important,\nbut then why focus on such a metric?\n\nRegardless, because of the nature of the question we went beyond just quantifying the correlation. \nIt exists, it is like 0.1 or 0.2.\nBut the question is of course if that is the cause or if there are confounders.\nAnd actually... logically the opposite would be a more logical formulation: \"more accident-prone workplace $\\rightarrow$ less likely to recommend\".\n\nThe simplest confounding model is:\n![...](/images/causal/causal_1.png)\n\nWhere we can label $C$ as our effect (increased frequency in workplace accidents). \n$B$ is the eNPS and $A$ are potential confounders.\nAs someone who had already studied eNPS from before I knew that you get pretty good $R^2$ of eNPS\nusing the employee survey average (also called engagement) and more specifically to questions like\n\"I know, understand and relate to our company-level strategy\". \nThat question alone can explain like 90% of the variance and is also *highly correlated* with how many managers are between you and the CEO.\n\nIn a nutshell, to estimate the isolated effect of $B \\rightarrow C$ we first need to account for $A \\rightarrow B$.\nWe do this by training a model $f(A) \\rightarrow B'$ and then we calculate the residual $r_B = B - B'$. \nIf we then fit another model $g(A) \\rightarrow C'$ and then we calculate the residual $r_C = C - C'$.\nNow we have removed all we know from $A$ from both $B$ and $C$. \nThe final step is then to see if $B$ have any effect on $C$ by training a final model $h(r_B) \\rightarrow r_C$.\nIf the model $h$ has no explainatory power then it points to $A$ carrying all the information.\n\nOne can do this and say that $B \\not\\rightarrow C$.\n\n# A random walk along the PyWhy libraries\n\nResources: https://www.pywhy.org/\n\n## EconML - Basics\n\nResources: https://www.pywhy.org/EconML/spec/causal_intro.html \n\nEconML is the PyWhy library for *automated learning and intelligence for causation and economics.*\n\nThis resource was a great start for me. \nI like the contrast between forecasting (like, predicting how many sales a video game will have next month)\nand causal modeling (like, understanding how many people will buy the game if we show an ad).\nMuch like Bayesian modeling; causal modeling requires you to write down and encode modeling assumptions.\nThe basic terminology is outcome (Y), treatment (T) and confounders (W). Confounders can be observed or unobserved.\n\nThe main thing that we are after is the conditional average treatment effect or CATE.\n\n### Method 1 - Randomized experiments\nThe gold standard for doing causal modeling is randomized experiments.\nIn the video game example they explain that gamers are more likely to get targeted by ads and more likely to buy games in the first place.\nBy randomly assigning ads, or in this experiment withholding ads, from gamers one can study the outcome. \nNote that this might not always be practical or possible to achieve hence why the field of research into causal models exists.\n\n### Method 2 - Measure confounders\n\nThis links to their page for *estimation methods under unconfoundness*: https://www.pywhy.org/EconML/spec/estimation.html\n\nWhen perfectly randomized experiments can not be performed then one can use this suite to estimate hetrogeneous treatment effects.\nThe theoretical guarantees only hold when all confounders are observed.\nThe suite contains four chapters:\n* **Orthogonal / Double machine learning (DML)**\n\u003Cbr>This is the methodology we described in the beginning of this post.\nFor this package the classes are `DML, LinearDML, SparseLinearDML, KernelDML, NonParamDML, CausalForestDML`.\nThe difference between these methods are how they create the residual models $h$. \nDML is generic while Linear, Sparse, Kernel use specific implementations.\nNonParamDML is technically a meta learner (later section) and CausalForestDML is a forest based estimator (also later section).\nSome example code:\u003C/br>\n```python\nfrom econml.dml import DML, SparseLinearDML, NonParamDML\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\n\nest = DML(model_y=GradientBoostingRegressor(),\n          model_t=GradientBoostingRegressor(),\n          model_final=LassoCV(fit_intercept=False))\n\nest = SparseLinearDML()\nest.fit(y, T, X=X, W=W)\npoint = est.effect(X, T0=T0, T1=T1)\nlb, ub = est.effect_interval(X, T0=T0, T1=T1, alpha=0.05)\n\nest = NonParamDML(model_y=GradientBoostingRegressor(),\n                  model_t=GradientBoostingRegressor(),\n                  model_final=GradientBoostingRegressor())\nest.fit(y, t, X=X, W=W)\n```\n* **Doubly robust learning**\n\u003Cbr>What if we are interested in creating a fully contextualized model instead of just understanding treatments?\nThat is where doubly robust learning comes in. \nSimilarly to DML it estimates hetreogenous treatment effects but then also predicts the outcome using data $X$.\nFor this package the classes are `DRLearner, LinearDRLearner, SparseLinearDRLearner, ForestDRLearner`.\u003C/br>\n```python\nfrom econml.dr import DRLearner, LinearDRLearner\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor, GradientBoostingClassifier\n\nest = DRLearner(model_regression=GradientBoostingRegressor(),\n                model_propensity=GradientBoostingClassifier(),\n                model_final=GradientBoostingRegressor())\nest.fit(y, T, X=X, W=W)\npoint = est.effect(X, T0=T0, T1=T1)\n\nest = LinearDRLearner()\nest.fit(y, T, X=X, W=W)\nest.effect(X, T0=t0, T1=t1)\n```\n* **Forest based estimators**\n\u003Cbr>When reading this section I am struck by the fact that it is simply DML or DR learners but these tree based models have specific desireable properties.\nThe estimators are `DMLOrthoForest`, `DROrthoForest`, `CausalForestDML`, `ForestDRLearner`. \nGenerally speaking this class of estimators are good when you have a lot of features, no good idea of how the effect heterogeneity looks like and they support confidence intervals. \u003C/br>\n```python\nfrom econml.orf import DMLOrthoForest, DROrthoForest\nfrom econml.sklearn_extensions.linear_model import LinearRegression, WeightedLasso\n\nest = DMLOrthoForest(n_trees=1, max_depth=1, subsample_ratio=1,\n                     model_T=LinearRegression(),\n                     model_Y=LinearRegression())\nest.fit(Y, T, X=W, W=W)\n\nest = DROrthoForest(n_trees=1, max_depth=1, subsample_ratio=1,\n                    propensity_model=sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression(),\n                    model_Y=LinearRegression())\nest.fit(Y, T, X=W, W=W)\n\nest = DMLOrthoForest(n_trees=100,\n                     max_depth=5,\n                     model_Y=WeightedLasso(alpha=0.01),\n                     model_T=WeightedLasso(alpha=0.01))\nest.fit(Y, T, X=X, W=W)\n```\n* **Meta-learners**\n\u003Cbr>This class of estimators generally do not give confidence intervals but offer full flexibility in model selection.\nOther than `NonParamDML` and `DRLearner` from before; this section convers T-, S- and X-learners as well as Domain Adaption Learner.\nFor a binary treatment $T$ (0 or 1) the T-learner trains one model $M_i(Y_i \\sim X_i)$ per treatment and estimates the CATE as $M_1(X_1) - M_0(X_0)$.\nThe S-learner trains one model with the treatment $T$ as one-hot encoded, the CATE estimate is therefore $M(X,T=1) - M(X,T=0)$.\nThe X-learner trains two models like the T-learner, \ncalculates the residuals $D_1 = Y_1 - M_1(X_1)$ and $D_0 = M_0(X_0) - Y_0$, \nfits the residuals with another pais of models $W_i(D_i \\sim X_i)$ and finally calculates the CATE as\n$\\tau = g(x)W_0(x) + (1-g(x))W_1(x)$, where $g(x)$ is an estimation of $p(T = 1\\|X)$.\nThe Domain Adaption Learner is a variation of the X-learner that weights \n$M_0(Y_0 \\sim X_0, w = \\frac{g(X_0)}{1-g(X_0)})$ and $M_1(Y_1 \\sim X_1, w = \\frac{1-g(X_1)}{g(X_1)})$,\nthen it similarly calculates residuals but fits a combined model $D$.\u003C/br>\n\n### Method 3 - Instrumental variables\n\nAn instrument is a variable that has an effect on the treatment but not directly with the outcome.\nThe IV methods allows you estimate CATE without all confounders if you have a valid instrument.\nHowever, if the effect on the treament is weak then the methods tend to be biased than measured confounders.\nThe best instruments are typically randomized or arbitrary assignments. \nThis is why IV methods typically are used for A/B testing or when a person from a pool as been assign to decide treatment.\n\nThe IV estimators in EconML are `OrthoIV`, `DMLIV`, `NonParamDMLIV`, `LinearDRIV`, \n`SparseLinearDRIV`, `ForestDRIV`, `IntentToTreatDRIV`, `LinearIntentToTreatDRIV`\nwhere the DML, DR are the methods from before. \nIntent to treat simply means that there is a randomized assignment of treatment groups which we use to analyse our results against.\n\n```python\nfrom econml.iv.dr import LinearIntentToTreatDRIV\n\nest = LinearIntentToTreatDRIV()\nest.fit(y, T, Z=Z, X=X, W=X)\nest.effect(X)\n```\n\n### Bonus method - Dynamic double machine learning\n\nEconML also has a section on dynamic estimation methods.\nThese are cases where multiple treatments have been offered over time and some final outcome is of interest.\n[This article from 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.07285) described the methodology.\n\n```python\nfrom econml.panel.dml import DynamicDML\n\nest = DynamicDML()\nest.fit(y_dyn, T_dyn, X=X_dyn, W=W_dyn, groups=groups)\nest.effect(X)\n```\n\n### Side note on EconML - Federated learning\n\nFederated learning is definitely a topic for another post but it seems that\nCATE estimation is something that can be nicely distributed across multiple models.\nThis is of course interesting in case one is prohibited from aggregating data from multiple sources.\n\n## DoWhy\n\nDoWhy is a tool that builds on tools like EconML that is made for tasks like:\n* Estimating causal effects\n* Quantify causal influence\n* Root-cause analysis and explaination\n* Asking and answering what-if questions\n* Predicting outcome for out-of-distribution samples\n\nDoWhy has four steps to causal inference:\n1. Modeling\n2. Identification\n3. Estimation\n4. Refuting\n\nTo run DoWhy one requires a causal graph of their problem (part of modeling).\nThese are best constructed using domain knowledge but can be assisted by data-driven methods like those from `causal-learn`.\nDoWhy expects the causal graphs to be encoded in a `networkx` graph.\n\n### Graphical causal models\n\nA GCM is a combination of a causal direct acyclic graph (DAG) of variables and a causal mechanism for each of the variables.\nThe mechanisms can be purely stochastic, conditional stochastic or functional.\nA GCM with stochastic parents and conditional stochastic children is called a probabalistic causal model (PCM).\nA GCM with stochastic parents and functional children is called a structural causal model (SCM).\nAn invertible SCM (ISCM) has invertible function, the most common being additive noise models $X_i = f(PA_{X_i}, N_i) = f'(PA_{X_i}) + N_i$,\nwhere $X_i$ is the variable at node $i$, $PA_{X_i}$ are its parents, $N_i$ is noise.\n\nWith a GCM one can hope to adress Judea Pearl's three levels of causality:\n1. Association - *What do we observe when X = x?* - PCM, SCM\n2. Intervention - *What will happen if we change X?* - PCM, SCM\n3. Counterfactuals - *What would we have observed if X had taken a different value?* - ISCM\n\nHere is how to set up a SCM for three variables $X, Y, Z$ in a chain.\n\n```python\nfrom dowhy import gcm\nimport networkx as nx\ncausal_model = gcm.StructuralCausalModel(nx.DiGraph([(\"X\", \"Y\"), (\"Y\", \"Z\")]))\ngcm.auto.assign_causal_mechanisms(causal_model, data)\n# alternatively (manually)\n# causal_model.set_causal_mechanism('X', gcm.EmpiricalDistribution())\n# causal_model.set_causal_mechanism('Y', gcm.AdditiveNoiseModel(gcm.ml.create_linear_regressor()))\n# causal_model.set_causal_mechanism('Z', gcm.AdditiveNoiseModel(gcm.ml.create_linear_regressor()))\ngcm.fit(causal_model, data)\n```\n\nWhen we have a GCM we can draw samples from it like:\n```python\ngenerated_data = gcm.draw_samples(causal_model, num_samples=1000)\n```\n\nAnd to evaluate it:\n```python\nsummary_evaluation = gcm.evaluate_causal_model(\n    causal_model, \n    data, \n    compare_mechanism_baselines = True\n)\nprint(summary_evaluation)\n```\n\n#### Confidence intervals\nDue to the random nature of the data and model fitting it is recommended by the authors of PyWhy to bootstrap confidence intervals.\nThis can be done to multiple rounds of training or just to the inference (when training is expensive).\n\n```python\nZ = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)\nX = 2*Z + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)\nY = 3*X + 4*Z + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)\ndata = pd.DataFrame(dict(X=X, Y=Y, Z=Z))\n\ncausal_model = gcm.StructuralCausalModel(\n    nx.DiGraph([('Z', 'Y'), ('Z', 'X'), ('X', 'Y')])\n)\ngcm.auto.assign_causal_mechanisms(causal_model, data)\n# fit model multiple times to get CI\nstrength_median, strength_intervals = gcm.confidence_intervals(\n    gcm.fit_and_compute(\n        gcm.arrow_strength,\n        causal_model,\n        bootstrap_training_data=data,\n        target_node='Y'\n    )\n)\n\n# alternatively: fit once and only calculate CI at inference\ngcm.fit(causal_model, data)\nstrength_median, strength_intervals = gcm.confidence_intervals(\n    gcm.bootstrap_sampling(\n        gcm.arrow_strength,\n        causal_model,\n        target_node='Y'\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Identification\n\nThe main class of PyWhy called `CausalModel` expects data, treatment and outcome with an optional graph argument.\nIf one supplies the graph then one can use the `.identify_effect()` method to get a report of methods for estimating the outcome.\nThe methods include backdoor, frontdoor and instrumental variables.\nEssentially a methodology selection.\n\n### Refute\n\n#### Refuting a causal graph\n\nOne concept of DoWhy is graph refutation, \nmeaning that we can test the assumptions that we have encoded through our domain knowledge or found using data-driven methods.\nThis is done by testing all conditional independence constraints, also known as local Markov conditions (LMCs).\n\n```python\nfrom dowhy.gcm.falsify import falsify_graph\n# causal_graph is a networkx digraph\nresult = falsify_graph(causal_graph, data, show_progress_bar=False)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe core idea behind LMCs are that there are three types of structures:\n* Colliders: $A \\rightarrow B$, $C \\rightarrow B$.\n* Forks: $B \\rightarrow A$, $B \\rightarrow C$.\n* Chains: $A \\rightarrow B$, $B \\rightarrow C$.\n\nBy definition, $A$ and $C$ are statistically independent in a collider.\nIn a fork they are dependent and in a chain $A$ and $C$ are *conditionally* independent on $B$.\nBy testing these parts of the graph using observed data one can potentially refute invalid assumptions.\n\n#### Refuting effect estimates\n\nAn effect refutation can be done either through negative control or sensitivity analysis.\nNegative control means that we consciously change something about the problem. \nIt is a family of sanity checks with two types:\n* Invariant transformations - These transformations do not change the premise of the problem. Methods include subsampling the data and adding an independent random common cause.\n* Nullifying transformations - Placebo treatment where one replaces the treatment with an independent random variable and dummy outcomes where one replaces the outcome should both nullify the effect.\n\nSensivity analysis adds an artificial confounder to the problem and studies the impact on the effect.\n\n```python\nres_placebo = model.refute_estimate(\n    identified_estimand, \n    estimate,\n    method_name=\"placebo_treatment_refuter\", \n    show_progress_bar=True, \n    placebo_type=\"permute\"\n)\nprint(res_placebo)\n\nres_random = model.refute_estimate(\n    identified_estimand, \n    estimate, \n    method_name=\"random_common_cause\", \n    show_progress_bar=True\n)\nprint(res_random)\n```\n\n# Examples of applying causal modeling\n\n## Exploring causes of hotel booking cancelations\n\n[Link](https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/v0.13/example_notebooks/DoWhy-The%20Causal%20Story%20Behind%20Hotel%20Booking%20Cancellations.html#)\n\n[Data source](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md)\n\nThis example has you study the effect of assigning a different hotel room on cancelations.\nFollowing the example one gets an effect of -0.26 meaning a negative effect on cancelations.\nThe causal graph they set up looks like this, which is quite a bowl of spaghetti:\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_2.png)\n\nTo decompose what they did, they say that *days in waiting list*, *hotel type*, *number of booking changes*,\n*is a repeated guest* and unknown confounders (U) influence whether or not a person gets assigned a different room.\nTo then determine cancelation they say that *lead time* (number of days from booking to arrival), *days in waiting list*,\n*hotel type*, *total number of special requests*, *number of booking changes*, *different room assignment*, \n*is a repeated guest*, *previous bookings canceled*, *total stay in days*, *number of guests* \nand *required car spaces* impacts it.\n\nThey reason that the negative effect is probably due to the unobserved confounder *\"showed up to the hotel\"* \nbecause a different room assignment is likely to happen on the day of your check-in.\nAnd that was about it for this example, but lets dig a little deeper.\n\nFirst of all, what are we dealing with here?\n\nHere is a table of the *reservation status*. Note that both canceled and no-shows are counted as cancelations.\n\n| reservation_status | size  | mean of is_canceled |\n|--------------------|-------|------|\n| Canceled           | 42954 | 1.0  |\n| Check-Out          | 74745 | 0.0  |\n| No-Show            | 1203  | 1.0  |\n\nAnd the definition of *different room assignment* is *reserved room type* $\\neq$ *assigned room type*.\nHere are the statistics for how often a room type was reserved / assigned and their corresponding mean of cancelations.\n\n| **Room type** | size of reserved | mean of reserved | size of assigned | mean of assigned |\n|---------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| **A**         | 85601            | 0.392273         | 73863            | 0.445487         |\n| **B**         | 1118             | 0.329159         | 2163             | 0.236708         |\n| **C**         | 931              | 0.330827         | 2354             | 0.188615         |\n| **D**         | 19173            | 0.318208         | 25166            | 0.252603         |\n| **E**         | 6497             | 0.293828         | 7738             | 0.253554         |\n| **F**         | 2890             | 0.304498         | 3732             | 0.248124         |\n| **G**         | 2083             | 0.366299         | 2539             | 0.307208         |\n| **H**         | 601              | 0.407654         | 708              | 0.354520         |\n| **L**         | 6                | 0.333333         | 1                | 1.000000         |\n| **P**         | 2                | 1.000000         | 2                | 1.000000         |\n| **I**         |                  |                  | 357              | 0.014006         |\n| **K**         |                  |                  | 279              | 0.043011         |\n\nNote that only room type A is where we have fewer assignments than resvations and that it is the only type\nwhere the rate of cancelation goes up (we except L and P as they are so few observations).\nAnother observation is I and K, which are not available during reservation but can be assigned\nand they have a very low rate of cancelation.\n\n| reserved_room_type | assigned_room_type | size | mean of is_canceled |\n|--------------------|--------------------|------|---------------------|\n| A                  | I                  | 211  | 0.009479            |\n| C                  | I                  | 9    | 0.111111            |\n| D                  | I                  | 67   | 0.014925            |\n| E                  | I                  | 39   | 0.000000            |\n| F                  | I                  | 10   | 0.000000            |\n| G                  | I                  | 15   | 0.066667            |\n| H                  | I                  | 6    | 0.000000            |\n| A                  | K                  | 210  | 0.033333            |\n| B                  | K                  | 2    | 0.000000            |\n| D                  | K                  | 44   | 0.113636            |\n| E                  | K                  | 16   | 0.000000            |\n| F                  | K                  | 3    | 0.000000            |\n| G                  | K                  | 4    | 0.000000            |\n\nIt also seems that they have a roughly equal assignment to the room reservation frequency (A then D, E and B, C, F, G).\nNow, it could just be that room types I and K are *really nice* or this is the frequency of cancelation when a customer\nturns up to the hotel. After all it is not that likely that you are going to cancel in the hotel lobby.\nActually, there is a way to somewhat gauge the quality of the rooms, which it by the average rate *adr* column.\n\n| **assigned_room_type** | count | mean | std | min | 25% | 50% | 75% | max |\n|------------------------|-------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| **A**                  | 40958 | 93   | 38  | 0   | 68  | 90  | 114 | 337 |\n| **B**                  | 1651  | 94   | 39  | 0   | 75  | 92  | 113 | 276 |\n| **C**                  | 1910  | 107  | 65  | 0   | 61  | 88  | 144 | 508 |\n| **D**                  | 18809 | 101  | 49  | 0   | 64  | 96  | 134 | 376 |\n| **E**                  | 5776  | 112  | 56  | 0   | 69  | 100 | 149 | 452 |\n| **F**                  | 2806  | 142  | 68  | 0   | 86  | 149 | 191 | 368 |\n| **G**                  | 1759  | 158  | 80  | 0   | 99  | 153 | 216 | 510 |\n| **H**                  | 457   | 159  | 84  | -6  | 93  | 150 | 211 | 402 |\n| **I**                  | 352   | 41   | 65  | 0   | 0   | 0   | 63  | 310 |\n| **K**                  | 267   | 53   | 61  | 0   | 0   | 8   | 100 | 283 |\n\nIt does seem like A through H is an increasing price ladder, meaning that H is more exclusive than A.\nNote that I and K have a low average and even medians close to or are zero. So these room assignments tend to be free(!).\nSo if we consider a higher letter to be an upgrade, how often does one get upgraded when a different room is assigned?\n\n|                | **Stayed** | **Canceled** |\n|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| **Downgraded** | 617        | 21           |\n| **Upgraded**   | 13289      | 772          |\n\nFor cancelations the upgrade rate is 97.4% and for regular stays it was 95.6%.\nIf one flips the question the cancelation rates for upgrades is 5.5% and for downgrades at 3.3%.\nThis again is another counter-intuitive insight, how does downgrades make people more likely to not cancel?\n\nBut another observation is the inbalance between stayed and canceled!\nNote from the first table that it is like 44k canceled to 75k stays.\nThe imbalance is also telling of the nature of this problem.\nMost room type changes occur to people who stay:\n\n|                | **Stayed** | **Canceled**

down it seems like 1. most room type changes are actually upgrades and \n2. that it when the treatment is applied (before or in the hotel lobby) matters for studying this phenomena further.\nProposing a different (simpler) model does not move the remove this issue.\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_3.png)\n\nThe effect estimate for the above example is -0.35 using propensity score weighting.\nThere are also no strong instrument variables for different room assignment.\nNonetheless the dataset is interesting to study but probably not the best example for causal modeling.\n\n\n## Root-cause of elevated latencies in a microservice architecture\n\n[Link](https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/v0.13/example_notebooks/gcm_rca_microservice_architecture.html)\n\nThe data is simulated using truncated exponentials, half normals and a Bernoulli hit-miss of the cache.\n\nThe causal graph reflects the system architecture.\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_4.png)\n\nUsing this causal graph and creating the model as:\n```python\nfrom dowhy import gcm\nfrom scipy.stats import halfnorm\n\ncausal_model = gcm.StructuralCausalModel(causal_graph)\nfor node in causal_graph.nodes:\n    if len(list(causal_graph.predecessors(node))) > 0:\n        causal_model.set_causal_mechanism(node, gcm.AdditiveNoiseModel(gcm.ml.create_linear_regressor()))\n    else:\n        causal_model.set_causal_mechanism(node, gcm.ScipyDistribution(halfnorm))\n```\n\nOne can fit the model to the data and evaluate the fit.\nFor empirical distributions one looks at the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.\nAll of the KL divergence is low so nothing to note there. \nFor the dependent nodes the documentation recomments the normalized continuous ranked probablility (nCRPS).\nCRPS generalizes the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to probabalistic predictions.\nIt gives a good idea of the model accuracy and calibration to the causal mechanisms.\n\n\n|

perfromance and not \"good\" like the others\n(presumably the threshold is $\\approx 0.3$).\nThis is expected as the data generation process for these two variables are non-additive noise models.\nThe cache has a multiplicative aspect due to cache misses and the product service is a max function of its upstream components, caching service included.\n\nNonetheless, the model can still be used to produce insights.\n\nNext step is to use the [attribute_anomalies](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/budhathoki22a/budhathoki22a.pdf) function to\nscore anomalous observations. In this example they have created an anomalous version of the data where the website is slower.\nBy bootstrapping one can get confidence intervals for this estimation as:\n```python\nmedian_attribs, uncertainty_attribs = gcm.confidence_intervals(\n    gcm.fit_and_compute(\n        gcm.attribute_anomalies,\n            causal_model,\n            normal_data,\n            target_node='Website',\n            anomaly_samples=outlier_data.iloc[[0]]\n    ),\n    num_bootstrap_resamples=10\n)\n```\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_5.png)\n\nHere the attribution states that the cache is the main driver of high latency.\nCustomer DB has a negative contribution, meaning that it was fast.\nProduct service also shows positive contribution but this could be a leaking effect from the caching due to the nonlinear relationships.\nIn order to get more clarity than this anecdotal example we can analyze 1000 anomalous samples using the [distribution_change](https://assets.amazon.science/b6/c0/604565d24d049a1b83355921cc6c/why-did-the-distribution-change.pdf) function.\n\n```python\nmedian_attribs, uncertainty_attribs = gcm.confidence_intervals(\n    lambda : gcm.distribution_change(\n        causal_model,\n        normal_data.sample(frac=0.6),\n        outlier_data.sample(frac=0.6),\n        'Website',\n        difference_estimation_func = lambda x, y: np.mean(y) - np.mean(x)),\n    num_bootstrap_resamples = 10\n)\n```\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_6.png)\n\nClear as day, it is the caching service that has experienced a distribution shift.\nUsing our causal model we can also simulate an intervention where we allocate resources from shupping cost service to caching service.\nWe trade 1 second faster of caching service for 2 seconds slower shipping cost. The code for this:\n```python\nmedian_mean_latencies, uncertainty_mean_latencies = gcm.confidence_intervals(\n    lambda : gcm.fit_and_compute(\n        gcm.interventional_samples,\n        causal_model,\n        outlier_data,\n        interventions = {\n            \"Caching Service\": lambda x: x-1,\n            \"Shipping Cost Service\": lambda x: x+2\n        },\n        observed_data = outlier_data)().mean().to_dict(),\n    num_bootstrap_resamples=10\n)\n```\nThe median mean latency of the website changes from 5.5 to 4.5 seconds.\n\n\n## Impact of 401(k) eligibility on net financial assets\n\n[Link](https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/v0.13/example_notebooks/gcm_401k_analysis.html)\n\n[Data source](https://martinspindler.r-universe.dev/datasets)\n\nIn this example the authors propose to study the effect of being eligible for a 401(k) plan on the net financial assets.\nThis is basically saying \"does this plan make people wealthier?\".\nRunning the example one is struck with the fact that connecting a binary variable to a number of $s becomes tricky.\nRetirement plans like 401(k) growths with age and higher income. It is a compounded process.\n\nTheir proposed causal graph is one where all covariates impact the treatment and the outcome.\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_7.png)\n\nBy pruning edges using causal minimality tests one gets the following causal graph instead:\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_7_2.png)\n\nThe code for the causal minimality test: \n```python\ndef test_causal_minimality(graph, target, data, method='kernel', significance_level=0.10, fdr_control_method='fdr_bh'):\n    p_vals = []\n    all_parents = list(graph.predecessors(target))\n    for node in all_parents:\n        tmp_conditioning_set = list(all_parents)\n        tmp_conditioning_set.remove(node)\n        p_vals.append(\n            gcm.independence_test(\n                data[target].to_numpy(), \n                data[node].to_numpy(), \n                data[tmp_conditioning_set].to_numpy(), \n                method=method\n            )\n        )\n\n    if fdr_control_method is not None:\n        p_vals = multipletests(p_vals, significance_level, method=fdr_control_method)[1]\n\n    nodes_above_threshold = []\n    nodes_below_threshold = []\n    for i, node in enumerate(all_parents):\n        if p_vals[i] \u003C significance_level:\n            nodes_above_threshold.append(node)\n        else:\n            nodes_below_threshold.append(node)\n\n    print(\"Significant connection:\", [(n, target) for n in sorted(nodes_above_threshold)])\n    print(\"Insignificant connection:\", [(n, target) for n in sorted(nodes_below_threshold)])\n\n    return sorted(nodes_below_threshold)\n```\n\nUpon seeing this I also thought that it would be interesting to try out some causality identification methods from causal-learn.\nUsing Peter-Clark algorithm for causal discovery one gets the following graph:\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_7_3.png)\n\nAnd using Fast Causal Inference (FCI) one gets this one:\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_7_4.png)\n\nAnd for Greedy Equivalence Search (GES):\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_7_5.png)\n\nAnd finally, Linear, Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM):\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_7_6.png)\n\nOut of all the methods only LiNGAM put e401 $\\rightarrow$ net financial assets.\n\nTo continue with the LiNGAM suggestion after pruning some edges:\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_7_7.png)\n\nUsing the auto assignment of causal mechanisms `gcm.auto.assign_causal_mechanisms` yields:\n\n```\nage Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using HistGradientBoostingRegressor\ninc Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using HistGradientBoostingRegressor\nfsize Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using Pipeline\neduc Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using LinearRegression\ndb Empirical Distribution\nmarr Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using HistGradientBoostingRegressor\ntwoearn Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using HistGradientBoostingRegressor\npira Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using Pipeline\nhown Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using HistGradientBoostingRegressor\nhequity Empirical Distribution\nhmort Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using HistGradientBoostingRegressor\nnohs Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using Pipeline\nhs Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using Pipeline\ne401 Classifier FCM based on HistGradientBoostingClassifier()\nnet_tfa Discrete AdditiveNoiseModel using HistGradientBoostingRegressor\n```\n\nThe model evaluation suite claims that the fit is only subpar, \nwhich makes sense that there is a ton of noise and the causality not being that strong.\nWhen we perform the same CATE per income bracket estimation as in the example we see some difference:\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_13.png)\n\nNote that the effect has a lower bound of approximately 0 for the lower 50% and that the higher earners have a higher lower bound.\nThis basically means that the effect is more inequal than the example made it out to be.\n\n\n## Intrinsic influence on river flow\n\nIn this example the authors extract flow (but personally I prefer water level) data for 5 measuring stations.\nThe [Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs](https://environment.data.gov.uk/hydrology/explore) provides it for free.\nThe five stations map out three tributaries to River Ribble, which is measure upsteam at New Jumbles Rock and downstream at Samlesbury\n\n![...](/images/causal/river-map.jpg)\n\nThe following causal graph can be constructed:\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_8.png)\n\nAnd fitted to the time series of the level measurements, taken every 15 mins.\nBelow is a line chart of the water levels for about a year.\nAs one can expect; floodings correlate.\nBut we want to figure out which are the more significant contributors.\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_10.png)\n\nUsing simple statistics from the table below we see that Henthorn both has the highest water level and correlation to Samlesbury.\nSo it could be that it contibutes the most. \nAlthough, consider that New Jumbles Rock add no new tributary, so its contribution should be negible.\n\n| ****                 | **Correlation to Samlesbury** | **Average river level** |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **Hodder-Place**     | 0.883594                      | 0.489060                |\n| **Whalley-Weir**     | 0.898620                      | 0.489290                |\n| **New-Jumbles-Rock** | 0.958220                      | 0.486724                |\n| **Henthorn**         | 0.962957                      | 0.576654                |\n| **Samlesbury**       | 1.000000                      | 1.227162                |\n\nSetting up the structual causal model as\n```python\nscm_river = gcm.StructuralCausalModel(river_graph)\ngcm.auto.assign_causal_mechanisms(scm_river, df)\ngcm.fit(scm_river, df)\n```\n\nOne can then calculate the [intrincic_causal_influence](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/janzing24a/janzing24a.pdf) for this model and data.\n```python\niccs_river = gcm.intrinsic_causal_influence(scm_river, target_node='Samlesbury')\n```\n\nBy normalizing the intrincic causal influence one gets the following attribution:\n![...](/images/causal/causal_9.png)\n\nNote that New Jumbles Rock is close to zero, as expected.\nSamlesbury has some unexplained noise, probably due to water seeping in between the measurement stations.\nThe highest contribution comes from Henthorn, then Hoddler-Place and lastly Whalley-Weir.\n\n\n## Counterfactual analysis in medical care\n\nIn this example the authors generate synthetic data.\nThere are 3 variables:\n* Condition, binary - Does the patient have a rare condition, for example an allergy.\n* Treatment, 3 options - 0 = Do nothing, 1 = Treatment 1, 2 = Treatment 2.\n* Vision, real value - The patients vision after treatment.\n\nWe get no information of the vision before treatment, which is basically the noise in this problem.\nThe causal model is can assume is simple.\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_11.png)\n\nThe `gcm.auto.assign_causal_mechanisms` fits an additive noise model using a histogram gradient boosting regressor.\nThe distributions for treatment and condition are empirical.\n\nNow, given a specific patient *Alice* we are interested in a counterfactual question.\nShe has a rare condition (= 1), took treatment 2 and she got a good vision after the treatment.\nUsing our model one can pose the counterfactual question of what would have happened if she would not have done the treatment or treatment 1.\n\n```python\ncounterfactual_data1 = gcm.counterfactual_samples(\n    causal_model,\n    {'Treatment': lambda x: 1},\n    observed_data = specific_patient_data\n)\n\ncounterfactual_data2 = gcm.counterfactual_samples(\n    causal_model,\n    {'Treatment': lambda x: 0},\n    observed_data = specific_patient_data\n)\n```\n\n![...](/images/causal/causal_12.png)","src/content/blog/causal-modeling.mdx","29d2640909cab54c","causal-modeling.mdx"]
