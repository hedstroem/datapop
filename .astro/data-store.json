This leave the nudge factor as a parameter. Here is a graph of the median estimations applied to Gaussian noise with two different nudges:\n\n![Two incremental median estimations](/images/inc_1.png)\n\nNote that nudge = 0.1 makes the estimate converge quicker than nudge = 0.01, but, the trade-off is that it is also more sensitive to noise. So, what is a good nudge factor?\n\nOne way is to approach is heuristically; say that we expect the estimator to approximately reach the median in M steps. \nSince the median is the 50th quantile; a worst case scenario where we start at the min or max means that we have to step 50 quantiles. \nThis means that we could choose $\\frac{max(max - median,\\: median - min)}{M}$ as the nudge factor. \nSince we do not know the median we can use the range $R = max - min$ as an upper bound $\\frac{R}{M}$. This is an extreme scenario where the median is close to either the min or max.\nFor the uniform scenario where the median lies dead in the middle between min and max it is twice as big, so then we will get to our estimate in $\\frac{M}{2}$ steps.\n\n![Incrementally estimating max and min](/images/inc_2.png)\n\nWith this method we have a bit more control, as can be seen in the following graph:\n\n![Comparison of different R/M nudges](/images/inc_3.png)\n\nEyeballing this particular example gives the M = 30, 16 steps and M = 120, 91 steps to get to the sample median. \nNow, there additional steps we can take to ensure a fair(er) nudging toward the median and it relates to $R$.\nWe do not expect our estimate of R to be close to the truth after only 3 or 10 observations, so what do we expect it to be and can we correct for that?\n\nFor $n$ samples selected uniformly on the interval [0,1) the expectation of the maximum is $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ and the minimum is $\\frac{1}{n+1}$.\nThis means the expectation of the range is\n$$\nE(R|n) = \\frac{n}{n+1} - \\frac{1}{n+1} = \\frac{n-1}{n+1}.\n$$\n\nThe intuition behind this is that $n$ samples split the line into $n+1$ sections and ordering them by size gives $1$ and $n$ as the first and final sections.\nOf course, our data is not likely uniformly distributed, but the quantiles are by definition.\nThis means that after, for example $n = 9$, we would have expected to seen 10% and 90% quantile with an 80 quantile range.\nBy $n = 99$ we will have seen from the 1% to the 99% quantile and subsequently the $n = 999$ sample gives us 0.1% to 99.9% quantile.\nThere are two take-aways from this observation.\n\nThe first is that we can invert the formula $R = \\frac{n-1}{n+1} \\rightarrow n = -\\frac{R+1}{R-1}$.\nThis is handy if we are looking for a specific quantile $q$, it corresponds to the range $R_q = 1-2q$ and by our formula $n = \\frac{1-q}{q}$. \nThis only makes sense for $q \u003C 0.5$ so for $q > 0.5$ we find its mirrored buddy $\\tilde{q} = 1 - q$. \nNow, specifically for the median this collapses to $n = 1$ but if we are going to look at any quantile then this will come in handy (like later in this post).\nIn essence, this estimate of $n$ will tell you when we it is likely to have seen the quantile we are estimating.\n\nThe second take away is that we can use the formula to create a better estimate $R_n$ out of our naive incremental $R$ as $R_n = \\frac{R}{\\frac{n-1}{n+1}} = \\frac{R(n+1)}{n-1}$. \nThis means that the range will scaled up to conpensate for likely unobserved range. This means that the full nudge heuristic is now $\\frac{R(n+1)}{M(n-1)}$. \nSee two examples below of the difference, one cherry-picked (note that the correction is only relevant when we need the nudges to be large) and one regular:\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/inc_4.png\",\n      alt: \"Improved convergence example 1\",\n      caption: \"Cherry-picked example\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/inc_5.png\",\n      alt: \"Improved convergence example 2\",\n      caption: \"Regular convergence\"\n    },\n  ]}\n  columns={2}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nIt is not much but it is something.\n\nThe elephant in the room are the variations in the estimate. \nSince we are observing random noise the estimates will follow the random sequences of nudges like a random walk.\nWhat we know about random walks of $n$ steps is that the expectation $E(\\mathcal{Z}_n) = 0$ with the variance $E(\\mathcal{Z}_n^2) = n$.\nSo if we have a random walk then we would expect the standard deviation to grow like $\\sqrt{n}$, meaning that we should shrink the nudges to compensate for this effect.\nOf course, we would only apply this after $M$ steps, when we have actually expected to converge to the median.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/inc_6.png\",\n      alt: \"Test of random walk penalty of the nudge amplitude\",\n      caption: \"Example 1: Gaussian\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/inc_7.png\",\n      alt: \"Test of random walk penalty of the nudge amplitude on an exponential distribution\",\n      caption: \"Example 2: Exponential\"\n    },\n  ]}\n  columns={2}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nBut, our system is not a true random walk because is it still an approximation of the median, so it will have some drift towards the true distribution median. \nSay that we are targeting the $q_t$ quantile (0.5 in case of the median) with $dq$ nudges (0.1 for our example) of our estimate $q$. \nIf $q = q_t$ then we have a 50/50 of being nudged in either direction, say + happens, then we are at $q + dq$. \nThis has now shifted the probabilities as we now have a 40/60 chance in favor of going back towards $q_t$.\nIf + happens again then we are at $q + 2dq$, meaning now a 30/70 chance next time. \nThe most extreme scenario has $dq = q_t$ when $q_t = 0.5$ as it always reverses its previous step, meaning that the distribution is 0: 25%, $q_t$: 50%, 1: 25%.\n\nOf course, we want to be able to assume any $dq$. \nTo get an intution behind this we simulated using $dq = \\frac{1}{50}$ and noted that is approximated a Gaussian distribution.\nIn the limit where $dq \\rightarrow 0$ it makes sense because then the drift back towards the median is less dominant. \n![Histogram of quantile estimations](/images/inc_8.png)\n\nWe run more experiments with different fractions of $\\frac{dq}{q_t}$, calculate the standard deviation, resulting in:\n![Experiments logging standard deviation of quantile estimations as a function of dq/qt](/images/inc_9.png)\n\nThe curve fitting is easy as it is a square root of the fraction and $x = 0.5$ neatly intersects $y = 0.25$. \nThis means that empirically we have arrived at the rubber band random walk standard deviation $\\sigma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\sqrt{\\frac{dq}{q_t}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{dq}{8q_t}}$. \nNote that this does not depend on $n$, which we conjectured above. \nSimiarly to what we have done before, we can shuffle expressions around to find the fraction given a target standard deviation $\\sigma$ as $\\frac{dq}{q_t} = 8\\sigma^2$.\nIf we were to calibrate a 95% confidence interval ($\\pm 1.96\\sigma$) over $\\pm 0.01$ quantiles ($\\rightarrow \\sigma = \\frac{0.01}{1.96}$) then $\\frac{dq}{q_t} \\approx 0.00021 \\rightarrow dq = 1/9604$ ($q_t = 0.5$).\nFor a more liberal $\\pm 0.025$ quantiles $\\frac{dq}{q_t} \\approx 0.0013 \\rightarrow dq = 1/1536.64$.\n\n\u003CImageGallery \n  images={[\n    {\n      src: \"/images/inc_10.png\",\n      alt: \"Example 1 of random walk confidence interval nudges\",\n      caption: \"Example 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      src: \"/images/inc_11.png\",\n      alt: \"Example 2 of random walk confidence interval nudges\",\n      caption: \"Example 2\"\n    },\n  ]}\n  columns={2}\n  layout=\"carousel\"\n/>\n\nThat has (kind-of) solved it! Now there are two possibilities to take this further, the first is to generalize to any quantile and the second is to adress non-stationarity.\nBut we save those for later posts :)","src/content/blog/incremental-median-estimation.mdx","e816d0035692a862","incremental-median-estimation.mdx",true,"reading-list",{"id":25,"data":27,"body":33,"filePath":34,"digest":35,"legacyId":36,"deferredRender":24},{"title":28,"description":29,"pubDate":30,"tags":31},"Reading list","Interesting books and articles",["Date","2025-07-10T00:00:00.000Z"],[32],"other","This reading list is updated sporadically.\n\n## Books\n\n- **Good to great** - *Jim Collins* \u003Cbr> \nThis book made me understand just *how* fundamental certain challenges can be to an organisation.\nBefore I used to think that if I, an employee, worked harder and spoke my mind; \nthat it would change the course of the group or the company for the better. \nAfter this book I realize that changing things to get positive development means reworking the DNA of the business.\nAnd that's not something a single contributor can do. \u003C/br>\n\n- **Build** - *Tony Fadell* \u003Cbr> \nLots of nuggets for how to think about products and organisation. \u003C/br>\n\n- **Measure what matters** - *John Doerr* \u003Cbr>\nThis book is the book on Objectives & Key Results, OKR's for short. \nI read this because a department manager wanted to introduce it to our group.\nI was intrigued how goals can progression can be tracked over different hierarchy levels.\nUnfortunately this manager did not do the theory justice nor did he actually follow up the scappy goals we set for the quarter.\u003C/br>\n\n- **Bullshit jobs** - *David Groeber* \u003Cbr> \nThe first half outlines job archetypes that passes the time without long-term productivity. \nIt is a dark and funny characterisation of modern, mostly white-collar, work.\nThe second half attempts to diagnose why we have gotten to this point.\nIt is an interesting perspective and worth the read. \u003C/br>\n\n## Take aways\n* No strategy can save a lack of culture and that no culture can save a lack of leadership.\n\n* The *Peter principle* and the *Dilbert principle* and the saying (by third source) \n\"that promotition to management was a terrible waste of competence, wasn't it?\"\nall point to a strange intersection of **Good to great** and **Bullshit jobs**.\nThe not-so-flattering way to put it is \"managers who have reached the limit of their\ncompetence will not identify and prioritize actual progess, instead they will \ninvent comfortable work and focus on prestige\".","src/content/blog/reading-list.mdx","6edea71c7b384012","reading-list.mdx"]
